Careers at Tactile
We create games with heart.

Our dedication to finely crafted games with global appeal has resulted in highly successful titles like Lily’s Garden, the Simon’s Cat game series, and most recently, Penny & Flo.

About Us

Located in the heart of charming Copenhagen, we believe the spirit of the city is infused in everything we do.

We value an open and amicable work environment based on individual freedom and responsibility. We believe that creativity can only truly thrive if you enjoy yourself as well as the company of your colleagues. Therefore, we strive to nurture a cordial and social atmosphere in which each individual is encouraged to grow and develop.

This is why we consider ourselves not only a growing company, but also a growing family.
