(ii) Cookies. Cookies are small information files that our Services, Sites and Features may place on your computer or other device. Cookies by themselves do not provide Starz with personally identifiable information. However, once you choose to furnish us with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in a cookie. In many instances you can turn off cookies in your web browser (see your browser's manual or help file for instructions), but if you do turn off cookies you may not be able to access parts of the Services, Sites and Features where cookies are used.

(iii) Embedded Scripts/Web Beacons. An embedded script is programming code used to collect information about how you interact with the Services, Sites and Features. The embedded script is temporarily downloaded onto your device from a Starz or third party web server and is active only while you are connected to the Services, Sites and Features. A web beacon is a small graphic image or programming code that may be included in our web pages and e-mail messages.

Starz may disclose personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information to distributors, contractors and third party agents we engage to provide services for Starz.

Starz may disclose your personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information to any successor or to any person or entity that acquires ownership or control of the Services, Sites and Features by any means. You hereby consent to the disclosure to, and use by, any such successor or subsequent owner or operator, and your continued use of the Services, Sites and Features signifies your agreement to be bound by such successor's or subsequent owner or operator's own privacy policy.

We may also use IP addresses in cooperation with Internet service providers to identify users if we deem it necessary to comply with laws, to enforce compliance with the Privacy Policy.

3. How To Update Your Personal Information. We will use reasonable efforts to allow you to update or correct personally identifiable information, to the extent that changing the data will not compromise privacy or security interests. Also, upon your request, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally delete your personally identifiable information from our database. However, it may be impossible to delete all of your information without some residual data because of backups and records of deletions. You can access and update the personally identifiable information that you have provided in connection with the Services, Sites and Features by visiting the My Account tool available within the Services. To help protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections to any personally identifiable information.

Any cause of action or claim you may have must be commenced within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arises.
