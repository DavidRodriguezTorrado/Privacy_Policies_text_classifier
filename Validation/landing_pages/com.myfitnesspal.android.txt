Education helped her lose 30 pounds.

MyFitnessPal gave me a wake up call to the way I was eating and made things clear what I needed to change.

-Stephanie

From fast-food addict to mindful eater.

I naturally fell into the concept of mindful eating… it takes 15-20 minutes for the food to hit your stomach, so I started eating slower.

-Eric

She was eager to make a change.

Now, when I have friends starting to run and getting frustrated, I tell them to just stick with it, eventually, you’ll get faster.
