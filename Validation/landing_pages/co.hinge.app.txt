Our Approach
Go on your 
last first date.

Hinge is built on the belief that anyone looking for love should be able to find it. It’s also built on an acclaimed Nobel-Prize-winning algorithm, so we can succeed in getting you out on promising dates, not keeping you on the app.

How we do it
Hinge Labs
We’re love scientists.

Our Hinge Labs researchers, behavioral analysts, and matchmakers study daters and compatibility so we can make Hinge better for you. We’ve gotten pretty good at it.

What Our Users Say

Other dating apps were like shooting fish in a barrel. But my girlfriend and I clicked right away on Hinge, and the conversation was effortless. We’ve been together for over a year.

Jake C.

Thank you Hinge! We’re getting married in a few months!

Kathryn B. and Nik N.

Hinge’s prompts really made the difference—I felt like I got a good sense of a guy’s vibe from his answers, and it was easy to jump right into a real conversation.

Let's work together

We’re looking for people who want to make dating effective, not addictive.
