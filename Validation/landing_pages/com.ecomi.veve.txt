Virtual Showrooms

Collectors display their collectibles with pride and with VeVe continue this in the digital realm. Create and customize virtual showrooms to showcase your digital collectibles and share this experience with other VeVe collectors around the world. Move through your virtual Showrooms on your phone, FPS game-style, or bring your showrooms to life in Augmented Reality and physically walk through them, all on your phone or tablet!

Digital in the real world with Augmented Reality


With VeVe's Augmented Reality features you can stand side by side with your favorite characters and heroes, in the real world. Simply scan your surrounding and tap to drop your digital collectible in AR. You can then move, rotate and  scale your digital collectibles to make the 1:1 size and then take photos.

Buy and sell with others in the secondary market


In VeVe's secondary Market you can buy and sell from other VeVe collectors. If you missed out on that digital collectible when it dropped, or you need one to complete your set, you can browse the secondary market and see if others have listed the collectibles you need for sale.

Coming 2022, the VeVeVerse will offer an immersive metaverse in which fans and collectors can stake their claim in a new and collaborative world of collecting.
