OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU

At Hinge, your privacy is a top priority. Your privacy is at the core of the way we design and build the services and products you know and love, so that you can fully trust them and focus on building meaningful connections.

We appreciate that you put your trust in us when you provide us with your information and we do not take this lightly.

We do not compromise with your privacy. We design all of our products and services with your privacy in mind. We involve experts from various fields, including legal, security, engineering, product design and others to make sure that no decision is taken without respect for your privacy.

We strive to be transparent in the way we process your data. Because we use many of the same online services you do, we know that insufficient information and overly complicated language are common issues in privacy policies. We take the exact opposite approach: we have written our Privacy Policy and related documents in plain language. We actually want you to read our policies and understand our privacy practices!

We work hard to keep your information secure. We have teams dedicated to keeping your data safe and secure. We constantly update our security practices and invest in our security efforts to enhance the safety of your information.

PRIVACY POLICY

Welcome to Hinge’s Privacy Policy. Thank you for taking the time to read it.

We appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend to always keep that trust. This starts with making sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and your choices regarding your information. This Policy describes our privacy practices in plain language, keeping legal and technical jargon to a minimum.

This Privacy Policy applies beginning 5/23/2019.

EFFECTIVE DATE: 5/23/2019

MTCH Technology Services Limited
Hinge
WeWork Charlemont Exchange
42 Charlemont Street
Dublin 2, D02 R593
Ireland

If you live outside the European Union, the company responsible for your information is:

2. WHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES

This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services operated by Hinge. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our “services” in this Privacy Policy. To make it extra clear, we’ve added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services.

Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a particular service has its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- applies.

3. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. We also collect information generated as you use our services, for example access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through a social media account. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.

Information you give us

You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes:

o When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth.

o When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos and videos. To add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album. Some of the information you choose to provide us may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in certain jurisdictions, for example your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation and religious beliefs. By choosing to provide this information, you consent to our processing of that information.

o When you participate in surveys, focus groups or market studies, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials.

o When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter.

o If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction. Sometimes, we monitor or record these interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service.

o If you ask us to communicate with or otherwise process information of other people (for example, if you ask us to send an email on your behalf to one of your friends), we collect the information about others that you give us in order to complete your request.

o Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as part of the operation of the services.

Information we receive from others

In addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:

o Other Users

Other users may provide information about you as they use our services. For instance, we may collect information about you from other users if they contact us about you.

o Social Media

You may be able to use your social media account (such as Facebook Login) to create and log into your Hinge account. This saves you from having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you to share some information from your social media account with us.

o Other Partners

We may receive info about you from our partners, for instance where Hinge ads are published on a partner’s websites and platforms (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign’s success).

Information collected when you use our services

When you use our services, we collect information about which features you’ve used, how you’ve used them and the devices you use to access our services. See below for more details:

o Usage Information

We collect information about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g., date and time you logged in, features you’ve been using, searches or search parameters, clicks and pages which have been shown to you, referring webpage address, advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, time and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and receive).

o Device information

We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including:

o hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, device-specific and apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (such as Google’s AAID and Apple's IDFA, both of which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device’ settings), browser type, version and language, operating system, time zones, identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (e.g., IMEI/UDID and MAC address); and

o information on your wireless and mobile network connection, like your service provider and signal strength.

o Other information with your consent

If you give us permission, we will be able to collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) in order to offer you features that make use of it. Such geolocation is collected through various means, depending on the service and device you’re using, including GPS, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections. If you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it.

Similarly, if you consent, we may collect your photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo, video or streaming on the services).

4. COOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES

We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to recognize you and/or your device(s). You may read our Cookie Policy for more information on why we use them (such as authenticating you, remembering your preferences and settings, analyzing site traffic and trends, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, allowing you to use social features) and how you can better control their use, through your browser settings and other tools.

Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including Hinge, do not currently respond to DNT signals.

5. HOW WE USE INFORMATION

The main reason we use your information is to deliver and improve our services. Additionally, we use your info to help keep you safe and to provide you with advertising that may be of interest to you. Read on for a more detailed explanation of the various reasons we use your information, together with practical examples.

o Link the various devices you use so that you can enjoy a consistent experience of our services on all of them. We do this by linking devices and browser data, such as when you log into your account on different devices or by using partial or full IP address, browser version and similar data about your devices to help identify and link them

To serve you relevant offers and ads

o Administer sweepstakes, contests, discounts or other offers

To process your information as described above, we rely on the following legal bases:

For instance, as you go about using our service to build meaningful connections, we use your information to maintain your account and your profile, to make it viewable to other users and recommend other users to you.

o Legitimate interests: We may use your information where we have legitimate interests to do so. For instance, we analyze users’ behavior on our services to continuously improve our offerings, we suggest offers we think might interest you, and we process information for administrative, fraud detection and other legal purposes.

o Consent: From time to time, we may ask for your consent to use your information for certain specific reasons. You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at the address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.

6. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION

Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, the main sharing of users’ information is, of course, with other people, as per your privacy settings. We also share some users’ information with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the services, with other Match Group companies and, in some cases, legal authorities. Read on for more details about how your information is shared with others.

o With other people

We share your information with other people as per your privacy settings (and in the case of any sharing features available on Hinge, the individuals or apps with whom you may choose to share your information with) when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your public profile). Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you’re comfortable being publicly viewable since neither you nor we can control what others do with your information once you share it.

If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or information about you, then it will be visible according to your settings.

o With our service providers and partners

We use third parties to help us operate and improve our services. These third parties assist us with various tasks, including data hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer care, marketing, advertising, payment processing and security operations.

We may also share information with partners who distribute and assist us in advertising our services. For instance, we may share limited information on you in hashed, non-human readable form to advertising partners.

We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any service provider or working with any partner. All of our service providers and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations.

o With other Match Group businesses

Hinge is part of the Match Group family of businesses which, as of the date of this Privacy Policy, includes websites and apps such as Tinder, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, Match, Meetic, BlackPeopleMeet, LoveScout24, OurTime, Pairs, ParPerfeito, and Twoo (for more details, click here).

We share your information with other Match Group companies:

For them to assist us in processing your information, as service providers, upon our instructions and on our behalf. Assistance provided by other Match Group companies may include technical processing operations, such as data hosting and maintenance, customer care, marketing and targeted advertising, finance and accounting assistance, better understanding how our service is used and users’ behavior to improve our service, securing our data and systems and fighting against spam, abuse, fraud, infringement and other wrongdoings.
In order to improve your chances at building significant connections with others: we may make you visible on other Match Group services or allow you to benefit from cross-platform functionalities. We will of course inform you of any such instance and comply with applicable law by, where relevant, allowing you to agree or to refuse. Examples of this may include the creation of a new service within Match Group, addressing a specific demographic that we feel would be interesting to you based on your demography or search criteria.

We may also share information with other Match Group companies for legitimate business purposes such as corporate audit, analysis and consolidated reporting as well as compliance with applicable laws. We may also share user information with other Match Group companies to remove users who violate our terms of service, or have been reported for criminal activity and/or bad behavior. In some instances, we may remove that user from all platforms.

o For corporate transactions

We may transfer your information if we are involved, whether in whole or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or control.

o When required by law

We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law); or (iii) to protect the safety of any person.

o To enforce legal rights

We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.

o With your consent or at your request

We may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties. In any such case, we will make it clear why we want to share the information.

We may use and share non-personal information (meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who you are such as device information, general demographics, general behavioral data, geolocation in de-identified form), as well as personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, under any of the above circumstances. We may also share this information with other Match Group companies, acting as our service providers, and other third parties (notably advertisers) to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our services and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine this information with additional non-personal information or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form collected from other sources. More information on our use of cookies and similar technologies can be found in our Cookie Policy.

7. CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS

Sharing of information laid out in Section 6 sometimes involves cross-border data transfers, for instance to the United States of America and other jurisdictions. As an example, where the service allows for users to be located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), their personal information is transferred to countries outside of the EEA. We use standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission or other suitable safeguard to permit data transfers from the EEA to other countries. Standard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data.

8. YOUR RIGHTS

We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with the following tools:

o Access / Update tools in the service. Tools and account settings that help you to access, rectify or delete information that you provided to us and that’s associated with your account directly within the service. If you have any question on those tools and settings, please contact our customer care team for help here.

o Device permissions. Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone book and location services as well as push notifications. You can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.

o Deletion. You can delete your account by using the corresponding functionality directly on the service.

We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a few key points to remember:

o Reviewing your information. Applicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of portability or variations of those terms). You can request a copy of your personal information by putting in such a request here.

o Updating your information. If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion or object to its processing, please contact us here.

For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests.

Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user. If you wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from him or her through our service, the other user will have to contact our Privacy Officer to provide their written consent before the information is released.

Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth.

o Uninstall. You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored. If you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities.

o Accountability. In certain countries, including in the European Union, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with notably may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where we are established.

9. RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA

If you are a California resident, you can request a notice disclosing the categories of personal information about you that we have shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year. To request this notice, please submit your request here. Please allow 30 days for a response. For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer such a request.

10. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. As with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure.

We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures.

We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately here.

11. HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION

We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as laid out in Section 5 and as permitted by applicable law.

In practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon deletion of your account, unless:

we must keep it to comply with applicable law;
we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law;
there is an outstanding or potential issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or
the information is kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security. For example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a new account.

Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific timeframe due to technical constraints.

12. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

Our services are restricted to users who are 18 years of age or older. We do not permit users under the age of 18 on our platform and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you suspect that a user is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available through the service.

13. PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES

Because we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections, this policy may change over time. We will notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.

Privacy Policy
Bumble Privacy Policy

Welcome to the Bumble Privacy Policy (“Policy”)! This explains how we collect, store, protect, and share your information, and with whom we share it. We suggest you read this in conjunction with our Terms and Conditions of Use.

Whilst you’re enjoying the Bumble mobile application (including the desktop version) (“App”), our websites and microsites (such as Bumble.com) or using our digital products and services (such as our competitions or surveys) (together, referred to in this Privacy Policy as our “Sites”), we collect some information about you. In addition, you may choose to use the App or Sites to share information with other users, including your friends and contacts (“Users”). We may also need to share your information sometimes.

The App and Sites are global, and your information will be sent to and used in the United States and the UK regardless of the country you reside in. This Policy explains how we protect your personal data when we transfer it overseas, so please read very carefully!

Who we are

The App and Sites are operated by the “Bumble Group” (also referred to in this policy as “we” or “us”) which includes Bumble Holding Limited, Badoo Trading Limited and Bumble Trading LLC, all of which are controllers of personal information collected and processed through the Bumble App and Sites.

The Bumble Group has designated a Data Protection Officer and they can be reached by emailing DPO@team.bumble.com or by post at the following address: The Broadgate Tower Third Floor, 20 Primrose Street, London, United Kingdom, EC2A 2RS.

1. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION.
Registration Information

When you download the App and create an account (“Account”), we may collect certain information (“Registration Information”) about you, such as:

Name;
Username;
Email address;
Mobile number;
Gender identity;
Date of birth;
Sexual preference;
Photographs;
Location; and
Login information for social media accounts that you connect to your Bumble Account (this could include, for example, your Facebook and Instagram accounts). For more information about this, see “Linking other Accounts to Bumble” in section 7 below.

Once you register, you will be able to review and change this information at any time just by logging in to Bumble (other than your date of birth and location (which, if you have given Bumble access to your location in your device settings, is automatically updated based on the location of your device)). It is your responsibility to ensure that your account details are kept up to date. If your phone number changes, please ensure that you update this in your account.

The information we collect helps to enhance the App and verify our Users (robots are not welcome!). Registration Information such as your sexual preference, name and username may be visible to other Users who view your profile page.

For Users who are California residents, the data we may collect falls within the following categories of “personal information”, as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):

Identifiers, such as name and location;
Personal information, as defined in the California customer records law, such as contact (including email and telephone number) and financial information;
Characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (if you choose to provide them), such as age, gender identity, marital status, sexual orientation, race, ancestry, national origin, religion, and medical conditions;
Commercial information, such as transaction information and purchase history;
Biometric information (not relevant here);
Internet or network activity information, such as browsing history and interactions with our Sites and App;
Geolocation data, such as mobile device location;
Audio, electronic, visual and similar information, such as photos and videos;
Professional or employment-related information, such as work history and prior employer;
Non-public education information; and
Inferences drawn from any of the personal information listed above to create a profile or summary about, for example, an individual’s preferences and characteristics.
Profile Information

We recommend and encourage you (and all our members) to think carefully about the information you disclose about yourself. We also do not recommend that you put email addresses, URLs, instant messaging details, phone numbers, full names or addresses, credit card details, national identity numbers, drivers’ licence details and other sensitive information which is open to abuse and misuse on your profile.

When you post information about yourself or use the messaging function to communicate with other Users, the amount of personal information you share is at your own risk. Please see Section 4 below for more information on who can access what you post on Bumble.

Profile Verification Information (Including Biometric Information)

For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible user experience, we require Users to verify their accounts and might ask for your phone number and, in some instances, we might also ask that you carry out photo verification. We want to make sure you are not a robot! And we also want to avoid fake Bumble accounts being created which can be used for malicious activities and cybercrime – they threaten the Bumble network and spoil things for everyone. This verification might be required by us for the prevention of fraud. You can also verify your photo on a voluntary basis (to add the blue ‘verified’ badge to your profile).

If you choose to verify your profile photo, we will scan each photo that you submit. The scan may include the use of facial recognition technology so that we can compare the photo you submit to your profile photo, to help ensure that you are who you say you are. We do not add the verification photos to your profile. We retain the scans so that we can verify you in the future and for our record-keeping purposes until we no longer need them for such purposes or for three years after your last interaction with us, whichever occurs first. After the applicable retention period expires, we take commercially reasonable steps to permanently and securely delete the scans from our systems.

Purchases Information

If you decide to purchase any of our premium services, we will process your payment information and retain this securely for the prevention of fraud and for audit/tax purposes.

Bumble uses automated decisions to prevent fraudulent payment transactions being processed as part of its anti-fraud procedures. In order to do this, our systems check payment transactions for behaviour that indicates breaches of our Terms and Conditions of Use. If a transaction meets certain criteria that demonstrate that the Terms and Conditions of Use are likely to have been breached and the transaction is likely to be fraudulent, the relevant transaction may automatically be blocked. Where a transaction is blocked, the user will be notified that their transaction cannot be processed and affected Users can contact Bumble to contest the decision.

Please note that if your account is blocked for any reason, any account(s) that you have on other Bumble Group platforms/applications, such as Badoo, may also be blocked as part of our anti-spam and anti-fraud procedures.

Geolocation Information

If you have given Bumble access to your location in your device settings, when you use your mobile, we will collect information about WiFi access points as well as other location information about your longitude and latitude and may save your device’s coordinates to offer certain features to you. This information helps us identify your physical location and we use it to personalise the App and make it easier for you to interact with other Users, by enabling the general locality information to be displayed to Users seeing your profile and showing you the profiles of other Users who are near you.

If you have given Bumble access to your location, but wish to turn this off, you can do so by the following methods:

iPhone app — settings, privacy, location services, Bumble
Android — settings, location, Bumble, permissions, location
Device Information

We may collect information about your device when you use the App including the unique device identifier, device model, operating system, and MAC address, for a number of purposes, as set out in this policy. In addition, if you permit us to do so, the App may access your device’s address book solely in order to add someone to your contacts.

Links

We may keep track of how you interact with links available on Bumble including third party services by redirecting clicks or through other means. We may share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.

Bumble Success Stories, Surveys and other Contributions

From time to time, we run surveys for research purposes and we may contact you to find out if you would like to take part. We may also contact you to find out if you would like to provide feedback, a testimonial or take part in marketing campaigns (for example, if you let us know that you have found a match on the App, we may contact you to ask if you would be happy to feature in advertising for Bumble). Such surveys and marketing campaigns are optional and more information will be provided at the point of contact. If you do not wish to be contacted to take part in a survey or marketing campaign, please contact our Customer Support Team via our Feedback Page.

When you Contact Customer Support

If you contact our Customer Support team via our Feedback Page, we will receive your email address, and may track your IP address, as well as the information you send to us to help resolve your query. We will keep records of our communications with you, including any complaints that we receive from you about other Users (and from other Users about you) for 6 years after deletion of your account.

Cookies and similar technologies

When you visit our Sites or when you use our App, we may collect personal data from you automatically by using cookies or similar technologies. A cookie is a small file that can be placed on your device or browser that allows us to recognise and remember you.

If you would like to find out more about cookies, including how we use them and what choices are available to you, please refer to our Cookie Policy.

2. USE OF YOUR INFORMATION.

Our main goal is to ensure your experience on Bumble is an enjoyable one and you don’t end up getting stung! In order to deliver an enjoyable experience to you, we may use your Registration and other information to:

offer you our services and features;
contact you with information about the App (e.g., updates and new features);
personalise the App/Sites and the content we deliver to you;
conduct research and analytics about how you use and interact with the App/Sites;
resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and to enforce our Terms & Conditions;
investigate fraud, protect our legal rights, and to enforce our Terms & Conditions.
to send you information about the promotions and offers we have available - if you’ve signed up for our communications or otherwise told us it’s OK (you can withdraw from marketing at any time via Settings in the App or by using the opt-out mechanisms and links provided in each message); and
protect our Users and third parties from harm.
Moderation Practices

We use a combination of automated systems and a team of moderators to monitor and review accounts (including photos and any other information uploaded onto user profiles) and messages for content that indicates breaches of our Terms and Conditions of Use. If an account or message meets certain criteria that demonstrate that the Terms and Conditions of Use are likely to have been breached, the relevant account will be subject to a warning and the user’s access restricted and/or blocked. Affected Users can contact Bumble to contest the decision.

Circumstances where data may be disclosed	Disclosed data
Service Providers – We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us. We may share your Registration Information or personal data with these third parties, but only for the purposes of performing these functions and providing such services. More information about this is available directly below.	This could include all data, including all CCPA Categories listed above

We will also cooperate with law enforcement enquiries from within or outside your country of residence where we are required to by law, where there is an investigation into alleged criminal behaviour or to protect the vital interests of a person. This may include preserving or disclosing any of your information, including your Registration Information, if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to comply with a law or regulation, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues e.g. through anti-spam providers to protect the service from criminal activity or to protect our rights or property or those of third parties. In such cases we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.	This could include any personal data that Bumble holds about you, depending on the nature of the request or the issue that we are dealing with, including all CCPA Categories listed above
Business Transfers – In the event that a Bumble Group entity or any of its affiliates undergoes a business transition or change of ownership, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, re-organisation, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, or in the event of insolvency or administration, we may be required to disclose your personal data.	This could include all personal data that Bumble holds about you, including all CCPA Categories listed above
Marketing Services Providers – To help us serve marketing and advertising on third party websites and applications and measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. More information on this is available below	Advertising identifier associated with your device (Device ID), estimated location (based on your IP address), age, gender and data about your visit to our Sites or App and action taken on those (for example if you downloaded our App or created an account with our App), hashed email address (for ‘custom audiences’ only) (CCPA Categories B, C, G, F and K)

MORE INFORMATION ABOUT DISCLOSURES


Sharing your personal data with Service Providers

We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us (“Service Providers”). The suppliers with which Bumble shares User personal data vary depending on a variety of factors, such as which of our App, Sites and services a User engages with. For example, to provide our services to Users, we typically use the following suppliers:

Billing services – to allow customers to purchase paid features of our App (for example, Google Play)
Authentication services – to allow customers to authenticate their account (for example, Twilio)
Social media providers – to allow customers to create/connect their Bumble account with their account(s) on such platforms (for example Facebook, Instagram or Spotify)
Product improvement and market research – we use third party platforms (such as Typeform) and agencies (such as Kantar) to carry out customer surveys and market research to improve our products and services
IT services – some of the third-party software providers used in the operation of our business may process Users’ personal data (for example, if a User contacts us via social media with a support inquiry, their inquiry is processed by our community management software provider Khoros)

We carry out due diligence on all Service Providers we engage to ensure they have adequate data protection and information security measures in place and only provide them with the personal data necessary to the service they are providing. Measures are taken to ensure that the data shared is non-attributable to the greatest extent possible and our suppliers are also subject to extensive obligations under our contractual arrangements, including strict data retention limits.

Sharing your personal data with Marketing Services Providers

We partner with providers of marketing services (such as Facebook for example) (‘Marketing Services Providers’) to help us market and advertise our App and services on third party websites and applications and measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. For example:

to exclude you from advertising campaigns aimed at finding new users, if you already have a Bumble account;
to show Bumble adverts to users who have visited the Bumble App/Sites but haven’t yet created a Bumble account;
to create an audience for our advertisements of other potential users who have similar characteristics to you based on the information the Marketing Service Providers holds about you (also known as a Lookalike Audience); or
to include you in a ‘custom audience’ that will receive Bumble advertising content (a custom audience is essentially a list of people who we think are most likely to be interested in a particular advertisement).

We share a limited amount of your personal data with these Marketing Services Providers, such as:

the advertising identifier associated with your device (this is a random number assigned by your mobile device manufacturer (for example Apple or Google) to your device to help advertisers (including the manufacturer) know when an ad has been viewed or clicked in an app, and when an ad causes a ‘conversion’ (for example, downloading the app advertised to you))
your estimated location (based on your IP address)
age and gender
data about your visit to our Sites or App and action taken on those (for example if you downloaded our App or created an account with our App)
a hashed* version of your email address (to create ‘custom audiences’).



*Hashing is a way of encrypting information by turning it into a combination of random numbers and letters - this code cannot be traced back to the email address. When hashed email addresses are sent to a Marketing Service Provider, they’re then matched against the Provider’s own existing list of their own users’ hashed information and our ads are served to those of our users who have successfully been matched with the Provider’s. Matched and unmatched hashes are then deleted by the Provider.

For more information about how we use cookies and other tracking technologies, including how you can set and manage your preferences with regards to such technologies, please see our Cookie Policy.

Some platforms require user consent before Bumble is permitted to use data gained through the platform for advertising purposes and where this is the case, Bumble will only use this data where the necessary consent has been obtained. Through your device’s privacy settings, you also have the option to prevent or limit device identifiers being shared with third party advertisers and what use is made of the device identifiers. If you would like more information about your choices and how you can stop your device identifiers being shared with third party advertisers, please visit this page.

In some cases, these third parties will also use the data that they collect for their own purposes, for example they may aggregate your data with other data they hold and use this to inform advertising related services provided to other clients.

Sharing with Facebook

Where we share data with Facebook as our Marketing Service Provider (including via the Facebook “Like” function), we are Joint Data Controllers with Facebook Ireland for this processing. This arrangement means that Bumble has to provide you this notice, but you should contact Facebook if you wish to exercise your data protection rights. Further information, including how Facebook enables you to exercise your data protection rights, and subsequently processes your information as independent data controller can be found in Facebook Ireland’s Data Policy. If you want more information relating to the nature of the arrangement we have in place with Facebook, please email DPO@team.bumble.com.

This data referred to above can include actions that you take on our website such as your interactions with our Sites or other information collected from cookies or similar technologies including the Facebook pixel. This allows us to measure the effectiveness of our advertising, improve our marketing practices, and helps us deliver more relevant advertising to you and people like you (including on social media such as Facebook).

4. WHAT OTHERS MAY SEE ABOUT YOU.

We think our Users are awesome, and we want you to share how awesome you are with the world, so we have built certain features to enable this. Our App is designed to make it easier for you to connect with other Users and to interact with them.

When using the Bumble App, you should assume that anything you post or submit on the App may be publicly-viewable and accessible, both by Users and non-users of the App. We want our Users to be careful about posting information that may eventually be made public.

Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your profile such as your religious denomination and health details. You may also choose to add sensitive information about yourself when you add certain Bumble badges to your profile, such as your religion and political leanings. While you may voluntarily provide this information to us when you create your profile, including your sexual preferences, there is no requirement to do so. Please remember that photographs that you post on Bumble may reveal information about yourself as well. Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive information about yourself, including through the addition of badges to your profile, you are explicitly consenting to our processing of this information and making it public to other Users.

Your Bumble profile and other information you make available via the App, including certain information added to your profile through third party accounts (such as Facebook, Instagram or Spotify – see section 7 of this Privacy Policy for more information about this) may be viewed and shared by Users with individuals who may or may not be users of the App. For example, a User may recommend you as a match to his or her Facebook friend(s) by taking a screenshot of your profile picture and sharing it, regardless of whether such friend(s) is also a User of the App.

Please also note that in certain countries (currently, South Korea only), Users are provided with functionality enabling them to download a copy of their conversation history (as this is required by local laws) and that Bumble has no control over how users may then publish or use that information.

If you log in to or access the App through your Facebook account or another third-party account on a device which you share with others, remember to log out of the App and the relevant third-party account when you leave the device in order to prevent other users from accessing your Bumble account.

5. OUR POLICY TOWARDS AGE.

Although we want as many people as possible to enjoy our creation, you have to be at least 18 years old to use the App - sorry kids, we know Bumble is cool, but you’ll have to come back when you’re old enough!

Bumble does not knowingly collect any information about or market to children, minors or anyone under the age of 18. If you are less than 18 years old, we request that you do not submit information to us. If we become aware that a child, minor or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and provided us with personal information, we will take steps to terminate that person’s registration.

6. SECURITY.

Here at Bumble, we pride ourselves on taking all appropriate security measures to help protect your information against loss, misuse and unauthorised access, or disclosure. We use reasonable security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information such as secured servers using firewalls.

Unfortunately, no website or Internet transmission is ever completely 100% secure and even we cannot guarantee that unauthorised access, hacking, data loss or other breaches will never occur, but here are some handy tips to help keep your data secure:

Please make sure you log out of your Account after use as you never know who may stumble onto your Account!
Please don’t share the password you use to access your Bumble Account with anyone else!
Change your password periodically.

If you ever think someone has had access to your password or Account, please follow the steps set out here. We cannot guarantee the security of your personal data while it is being transmitted to our site and any transmission is at your own risk.

7. LINKING OTHER ACCOUNTS TO BUMBLE.
Using your social media details to sign in to Bumble

When you sign in to our App using your Facebook account, you give permission to Facebook to share with us your name and profile picture. Unless you opt-out, you also give permission to Facebook to share with us your email address (if there is one associated with your Facebook account), date of birth, profile photos, gender, Page likes and current town/city.

If you register or sign in with your Apple ID, you give Apple permission to share your Apple login, a name (that can be edited by you) and an email (you can choose to hide your email and Apple will create a random email address so your personal email can stay private). This email address will be linked to your Bumble account and will be used to retrieve your Bumble account.

We will then use this personal data to form your Bumble account. If you remove the Bumble app from your Facebook settings, or from your Apple ID, we will no longer have access to this data. However, we will still have the personal data that we received when you first set up your Bumble account using your Facebook or Apple ID (you must delete your Bumble account entirely for us to no longer have access to this data).

Linking social media accounts to your Bumble account

You may link your Bumble account with your Instagram, Facebook or Spotify accounts. This allows you to share some information from those accounts directly to your Bumble account (for example, Instagram photos, or your top Spotify artists).

We only receive the limited information that Instagram or Spotify permits to be transferred (as detailed by Instagram/Facebook/Spotify and agreed by you when you first connect your account from such platforms with your Bumble account).

If you no longer want to link your Bumble account to your Instagram, Facebook or Spotify account, please visit the settings in your Instagram, Facebook or Spotify account and follow the instructions to remove the Bumble app access permissions. Please note that any information already added to your Bumble account from those platforms will not be deleted unless you delete it within your Bumble account as well.

8. INFORMATION FOR BFF MEMBERS.

If you use BFF we’ll ask you for some information when you create your profile (like your beliefs and political leanings). You can choose to give this information, but there’s no obligation to provide it.

Our legal justification for processing your personal data is that this is necessary in order to fulfil our contract with you and deliver certain services and features you’ve requested. For example, in order to offer you our Hives feature, we need to process your location and interests data to show you Hives that you can join and that are relevant to you. When you upload and choose to share sensitive information (such as beliefs and political leanings), you are explicitly consenting to sharing that information with BFF members.

Using Your Information to Recommend Friends

In BFF we may use your activity, life and interests information to recommend friends.

Important Things to Know About BFF Hives

In BFF you can join or create Hives to find friends. Hives are small, local group chats built around locations or topics. We’ll recommend Hives based on your location, activity, life and interests information.

Who Sees Your Hive Membership and Messages

If you join a Hive, other BFF members will be able to see that you’ve joined that Hive. Members will not be able to see the Hive chat until they join the Hive and when they join they’ll see the full message history.

9. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.

For Users who are California residents, you have the following rights (in addition to those listed at section 10 below) under the California Consumer Privacy Act, and you have the right to be free from unlawful discrimination for exercising your rights under the Act:

You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you and explain how we have collected, used and shared your personal information over the past 12 months.
You have the right to request that we delete your personal information that we collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.

California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. If you wish to find out about any rights you may have under California Civil Code section 1798.83, you can write to us at feedback@team.bumble.com.

From time to time, as part of a joint promotion with a third party, we may, if you participate in such promotion, disclose your contact information to the third party to allow them to market their products or services to you. Where this is a condition for participation in a promotion, we will always let you know before when you enter the promotion. Please follow the instructions provided to you by third parties to unsubscribe from their messages.

In addition, under California law, operators of online services are required to disclose how they respond to “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information of a consumer over time and across third party online services, to the extent the operator engages in that collection. At this time, we do not track our Users’ personal information over time and across third-party online services. This law also requires operators of online services to disclose whether third parties may collect personal information about their users’ online activities over time and across different online services when the users use the operator’s service. We do not knowingly permit third parties to collect personal information about an individual User’s online activities over time and across different online services when using the App.

10. YOUR RIGHTS.

Privacy laws applicable in your country may give you the following rights:

Right to be informed: what personal data an organisation is processing and why (we provide this information to you in this Privacy Policy).
Right of access: you can request a copy of your data.
Right of rectification: if the data held is inaccurate, you have the right to have it corrected.
Right to erasure: you have the right to have your data deleted in certain circumstances.
Right to restrict processing: in limited circumstances, you have the right to request that processing is stopped but the data retained.
Right to data portability: you can request a copy of certain data in a machine-readable form that can be transferred to another provider.
Right to object: in certain circumstances (including where data is processed on the basis of legitimate interests or for the purposes of marketing) you may object to that processing.
Rights related to automated decision-making including profiling: there are several rights in this area where processing carried out on a solely automated basis results in a decision which has legal or significant effects for the individual. In these circumstances your rights include the right to ensure that there is human intervention in the decision-making process.

The particular rights which are applicable to you (which might include other rights not listed above) may vary depending on your country. You should make yourself aware of the rights you have under applicable privacy laws in your country.

If you want to exercise any of your rights listed above please visit our Feedback Page or email our Data Protection Officer at DPO@team.bumble.com. You can also contact us by post at the following address: The Broadgate Tower Third Floor, 20 Primrose Street, London, United Kingdom, EC2A 2RS. For your protection and the protection of all of our Users, we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity before we can answer the above requests.

If you have a concern about how we have processed your request or your personal data, you should contact us in the first instance via the contact details listed above.

If you feel we have not resolved your concern, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). If you live in a country or territory located in the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA), you may also get in touch with your local Data Protection Regulator. If you live in a country outside the EU, you may have the right to lodge a complaint with your local privacy or data protection regulator.

Using the online request form at https://services.nathantrust.com/privacycontact

Postal address: 1st Floor, 6 Lapps Quay, Cork, Ireland

11. DATA LOCATIONS.

We want you to be able to access Bumble wherever you happen to be in the world. To enable us to provide that service, we operate a global network of servers including in the US, UK, EU, and (for Users located in Russia) Russia. The hardware is located in third-party data centres but is owned by the Bumble Group. Data collected by Advertising Partners and other Service Providers may also be held outside the UK and the European Economic Area. We ensure that the data is adequately protected by ensuring that valid, legal mechanisms are in place such as: EU approved model clauses (which can be found here), and implementing robust contractual standards. If you want more information relating to the nature of the safeguards we have in place, please email DPO@team.bumble.com.

12. DATA RETENTION AND DELETION.

We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for the legal basis relied upon (as set out in Section 2 above) and as permitted by applicable law. Please see “Profile Verification Information (Including Biometric Information)” in Section 1, above, to learn about our retention policy with respect to biometric information.

When you delete your Account, or it is deactivated by us, we make sure it is no longer viewable in the App. For up to 28 days, it is still possible to restore your Account if it was accidentally deleted or wrongfully deactivated. After 28 days, we begin the process of deleting your personal information from our systems, unless:

we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, if you make purchases within the App, some personal data may be kept for tax and accounting purposes);
we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for example, if an account is blocked, we keep some account information and a record of the behaviour that led to the block - this information is retained for evidential purposes in case of queries or legal claims concerning the block);
there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or
the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing Users’ safety and security (for example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behaviour or security incidents from opening a new account).

Warning: Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your Account, copies of that information may still be viewable and/or accessed to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by others. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your personal information, they may retain such information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies.

Thanks for reading, we hope we didn’t drone on for too long!

13. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY.

As Bumble evolves, we may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at bumble.com/privacy. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you, for example, via an email to the email associated with your Account or by posting a notice within Bumble.

Starz is committed to helping users of its Services, Sites and Features understand the information that Starz collects, how Starz uses that information, the choices users have about the way their information is used, and the precautions Starz takes to protect information concerning its users. This Privacy Policy applies specifically to the Services, Sites and Features only, and covers information collected on or through the Services, Sites and Features. When using other Starz web sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policy controlling that particular site.

1. Information We Collect.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any personally identifiable information you may disclose in public areas of the Services, Sites and Features. When you voluntarily post information in public areas of the Services, Sites and Features, that information can be collected and used by third parties. Starz assumes no responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties who collect information that users disclose on public areas of the Services, Sites and Features.

b. Non-personally Identifiable Information.

Additionally, we may collect your IP address or device identifier (""Device ID"" ). A Device ID is a unique number assigned to the device(s) or network you use to access the Services, Sites and Features. If we associate Usage Information with your Device ID we will treat such information as personally identifiable information.

(ii) Cookies. Cookies are small information files that our Services, Sites and Features may place on your computer or other device. Cookies by themselves do not provide Starz with personally identifiable information. However, once you choose to furnish us with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in a cookie.

3. WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS SOURCES

Directly from you: We, as well as our service providers, collect personal information directly from you when you use the Platforms, for example to register to create an account, update your information, sign up for a subscription, use certain features, complete a profile or otherwise tell us about your preferences, access or download content, purchase items or enter into promotions, post content to the Platforms, refer others to the Platforms, interact with us via third party applications or social media sites, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. We collect personal information when you create an iHeartRadio Code. If you apply for a job, we also collect Employment-Related info and any other personal information you to provide (such as self-identifying information).

Automatically from your devices: We, as well as advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of tracking tools and technologies that automatically or passively collect information like Browser/Usage/Device Information and Location Information any time you visit or interact with the Platforms, our emails, and our advertising and content on other websites and platforms.

Vendors and service providers: We receive personal information about you from our vendors and service providers we hire to help us run our business, including those companies that host, protect, or operate our Platforms; analyze data; collect debts for us; provide customer service; send emails for us; process payments; conduct surveys; fulfill orders; run our promotional activities and contests; or provide marketing, analytics, and advertising services.

Business partners: We receive personal information about you from our business partners, including those businesses with whom we offer joint or co-branded promotions, or who advertise on the Platforms. We may also get personal information from advertising networks and search information providers.

Social media: If you create an account using your credentials from a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on our Platforms to your profile page to share with others within your network. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a social media application or website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their ""connections"" or if information about you is otherwise accessible through your ""connections'"" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party website or interactive service.

Other users: Other users may decide to provide us with your personal information (such as Identifiers) so that we may invite you to join iHeartMedia or so that we may facilitate communication between users of the Platforms.

We combine information: When we get information from other sources, we may combine that with information we already have. We may combine information that we have collected offline with information we collect online or through the Platforms. We may also aggregate your information with other consumers’ information to understand preferences and trends within your peer group over time.

 4. WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH OTHERS

We may share personal information as described below:

Affiliates: We may share personal information with our affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership with iHeartMedia.

Vendors and service providers: We may share personal information with vendors and service providers we hire to help us run our business, including those companies that host, protect, or operate our Platforms; analyze data; provide customer service, send emails for us; process payments; conduct surveys; fulfill orders; run our promotional activities and contests; or provide marketing, analytics, and advertising services.

Business partners, rights holders, advertisers, and advertising companies: We may share or make available personal information with or to our sponsors, partners, advertisers, advertising networks, advertising servers, and analytics companies or other third parties in connection with our and their marketing, promotional, and other offers, as well as product information. These third parties may use your personal information for their own advertising, analytics, planning, market research, or other business purposes. We may also share your information with the rights holders that license content to iHeartMedia to stream on the Platforms (e.g., artists or record labels). If you connect your iHeartMedia account to a third party application or social media platform, iHeartMedia may automatically share your personal information with that service, and such information may be attributed to your account on the third party platform and published on such service. Likewise, if you log into a third party application with your iHeartMedia account, that third party application may have access to certain information such as your iHeartMedia playlists and activity. Some transfers of your personal information to these other companies may be viewed as a “sale” under certain state laws.

Nielsen: Our Platforms may include Nielsen's proprietary measurement software which may allow you to contribute to market research. To learn more about the information Nielsen's software may collect and your choices with regard to it, please go to https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/legal/privacy-statement/digital-measurement/. If you would like to opt-out of participating, please go to https://priv-policy.imrworldwide.com/priv/browser/cookie-policy-us-en.html?optout=1.

Other users: iHeartMedia is a social service that offers many ways to find, enjoy, and share content. Your name and/or username, profile picture, who you follow, your followers, and your iHeartMedia user profile are publicly available to other subscribers. Your activity on the Platform (e.g., music you listen to, music you share), playlists created or followed, and content you post to the Platform are made publicly available by default and can be accessed by users who follow you or view your iHeartMedia profile and will also be displayed publicly in third-party search engine results and may appear together with other public profile information, such as your playlists, picture and name and/or username. This information is made public by default, but you can limit this sharing as described in the ""Your Choices"" section below.

Business transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets. If another entity acquires us or all or substantially all of our assets, or assets related to the Platforms, your information may be disclosed to such entity as part of the due diligence process and may be transferred to such entity as one of the transferred assets. Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties.

 

SDK Partners: We may make available personal information to third party technology companies whose software development kits (SDKs) or application programming interfaces (APIs) are embedded into our mobile apps.

Legal compliance: We may share personal information with third parties to comply with a legal obligation; when we believe in good faith that the law requires it; at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; to verify or enforce our Terms of Use or other applicable policies; to respond to an emergency; or otherwise to protect the rights, property, safety, or security of other parties, visitors to our Platforms, or the public.

Other disclosures: We may share personal information for other reasons we may describe to you from time to time as permitted by law.

Non-personal information: We may share information that has been de-identified or aggregated such that it does not identify or relate to you, with other parties for any purpose. This may include aggregated user statistics about the Platforms or aggregated demographic information about our users.

Interest-Based Advertising:

When you use the Platforms, we, our service providers, and advertising partners may place cookies and similar tracking technologies on your computer or Device in order to collect information about your online web-browsing activities over time and across different websites and online services or mobile applications, in order to serve you ads or other content personalized to your interests. This form of advertising is referred to as Interest Based Advertising (“IBA”). In order to personalize these ads or content, we or our advertising partners or service providers may connect and/or share personal information about you either to data you provided to us or to Browser/Usage/Device Information and Location Information collected about you.

You can opt out of being tracked online for IBA purposes by going to https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN or https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1.

Another way to opt out of IBA is by clicking on the Advertising Options Icon featured on certain iHeartMedia ads on third-party websites. When clicked it (1) describes the collection and uses of data gathered at the relevant party website and (2) provides a way for you to opt out of data collection and use by the other parties listed for the purposes of IBA.

Choices you make are device-specific and browser-specific. If you use different browsers on your computer, or multiple computers and Devices, you will need to opt out of IBA from each browser on each of the computers and Devices that you use. Please note that even if you opt out of IBA, you may still receive advertisements from us; they just won't be customized based on your web-browsing activities on third-party websites. Please also note that if you opt-out of IBA, we may still track your visits to the Platforms for our own analytics, operations and security purposes.

Notice To European Residents – Your GDPR Privacy Rights:

On May 25, 2018, a new European Union (EU) data protection law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), takes effect. The GDPR gives individuals in the EU more control over how their Personal Information is used and places certain obligations on businesses that process information of those individuals. We’ve updated our Privacy Policy to take into account the new requirements of the GDPR.

Cricut, Inc. is the data controller for all GDPR requirements. For questions or to contact the data protection compliance representative, email privacyrequest@cricut.com or send postal mail to Cricut, Inc. Attn: Privacy Data Processor, 10855 South River Front Parkway, Suite 300, South Jordan, Utah U.S.A. 84095.

Notice To California Residents – Your California Privacy Rights:

Effective January 1, 2005, under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (known as the “Shine the Light” law), if an individual who is a California resident has provided Personal Information to a business in connection with a business relationship that is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and if that business has within the immediately preceding calendar year disclosed such an individual’s Personal Information to a third party and knows or should have known that such third party used the information for its own direct marketing purposes, then that business is obligated to disclose in writing to such individual upon request, what Personal Information was shared and with whom it was shared. A business may comply with this law by: (i) having EITHER a published privacy policy of not sharing a member’s Personal Information for third parties’ direct marketing use unless the member has first affirmatively opted in to such sharing OR a published privacy policy of not sharing a member’s Personal Information for third-parties’ direct marketing use if the member has opted out to prevent his/her Personal Information from being shared for direct marketing use; AND (ii) notifying the member of his/her right to opt out and providing a cost-free means for the member to exercise that right.

We do not, but may in the future, share Personal Information with non-affiliated third parties so that they may offer, market, and advertise products and services directly to our members. If and when that happens, we will provide our members the choice to opt out of such information sharing. Any request for a disclosure required under this California law should be sent to us via email at privacyrequest@cricut.com or via postal mail at Cricut, Inc., Attn: Privacy Data Processor, 10855 South River Front Parkway, Suite 300, South Jordan, Utah U.S.A. 84095. Please note that under this law, we are not required to respond to a member’s request more than once in a calendar year, nor are we required to respond to any request that is not sent to the email or mailing address designated above.

1. Types of information we collect
Personal Information. “Personal Information” refers to your personally identifiable information, including first and last name, telephone number, email address, mailing address, IP address, and Payment Account Information (as defined below). Many areas and features on our Site do not require registration and may be accessed by you without having to disclose any Personal Information. However, to the extent you voluntarily provide your Personal Information to us, we collect such information. For example, we collect Personal Information from you: (i) when you register to become a member on our Site; (ii) when you register to participate in a Sponsored Activity; (iii) when you join our electronic mailing list; (iv) when you purchase a product or service from us online (in such event, we collect your credit card, bank account, or other payment account information (“Payment Account Information”) in order for us to accept, process, manage, and fulfill a purchase order as well as to process a return and refund request from you after the purchase); (v) when you submit a request or inquiry to us on our Site; and/or (vi) when you interact with Member Care (in such event, we collect details regarding your interactions with Member Care, such as the date, time and reason for contacting us, transcripts of any chat conversations, and if you call us, your phone number). Each of the above means of furnishing Personal Information is referred to as a “Transaction or Request.” You control the decision to disclose your Personal Information. However, without your Personal Information, we will not be able to process your Transaction or Request.
Aggregate and Anonymous Information. “Aggregate and Anonymous Information” means any information that does not identify you individually. For example, we may collect anonymous group data (demographics, interests and preferences, etc.) about members when they register to become members on our Site or to participate in a Sponsored Activity. We also collect aggregate traffic data pertaining to our Site, such as: total page views in a given time period; total impressions per ad; average amount of time that visitors spend on our Site each time they visit; average amount of time that visitors spend on each page of our Site; percentage of visitors from a certain geographical area, etc. Moreover, we may combine “User Activity Information” (as described below) about you and other users of our Site to generate aggregate information that reflects activities, habits, preferences, interests, etc. about our users as a group. In addition, we may take Personal Information and make it non-personally identifiable, such as by aggregating your information with information about other individuals, or by removing personally-identifiable elements (such as names) so as to “anonymize” or “de-personalize” your information.
User Activity Information. “User Activity Information” means information we collect about user activities on our Site. For example, our Site servers automatically collect and log “clickstream data” for all visitors to our Site, such as IP addresses (which are numerical numbers that are automatically assigned to users’ computers and mobile devices when they are surfing the Internet), page requests, pages visited, content viewed, clicks and search queries made, etc. We also use cookies and web beacons to collect user activity information on our Site (see Section 6 below for more information). We collect information regarding you and your use of our Sponsored Activities as well as information regarding your machine(s) used to access our Sponsored Activities. This information includes your activity on Design Space such as selections, design history and search queries, etc.

To the extent we use User Activity Information in a manner that identifies a specific user individually (e.g., if we link or associate such information with name or address), it will be treated as Personal Information. Otherwise, User Activity Information will be treated as Aggregate and Anonymous Information.

2. Our use of information

Cricut processes your Personal Information under a lawful basis based on your consent by participating in a Sponsored Activity. We use information collected from and about our users and members to improve our products and Sponsored Activities, to improve the pages and content of our Site, to administer and maintain operations of our Site, to administer and manage transactions and relationships with our users and members, to offer, market and advertise products and services to our users and members, and to conduct market research and analysis.

For Transactional, Administrative, and Member Relation Purposes. If you provide Personal Information to us in connection with a Transaction or Request we will use your information to process, administer, manage, and communicate with you regarding, such Transaction or Request. For example: (i) if you register as a member on our Site, we will use your information to set up, administer, service, and communicate with you regarding, your account; (ii) if you register to participate in a Sponsored Activity, we will use your information to process your entry and to conduct and administer the event (including, in the case of a contest or sweepstakes, communicating with you in the event you are selected as a winner); (iii) if you join our electronic mailing list, we will use your information to send you our electronic communications, including our newsletters and our company announcements, notices and updates; (iv) if you purchase a product from us, we will use your information to process and fulfill your order, to communicate with you regarding the same, and to provide member care to you; please note that we will use your Payment Account Information only for purposes related to your purchase and will not use such information for any other purposes; and (v) if you submit a request or inquiry to us, we will use your information to respond to your request or inquiry. Also, if you provide your email address or mailing address to us, we may use such address to send you notices of a transactional, administrative, or relationship nature or as required by law, such as notice of a material change in this Privacy Policy and/or the Terms of Use for our Site, notice of an actual or suspected security breach that affects your Personal Information stored by or for us, etc.
For Marketing and Advertising Purposes. We may use your Personal Information or User Activity Information to offer, market and advertise to you, on our Site and/or via email, our and/or third party products and services that may be of interest to you.
For Market Research Purposes. We may use Aggregate and Anonymous Information (including such information derived from Personal Information and User Activity Information) to conduct market research and analysis for ourselves as well as for our sponsors and business partners. If we do combine non-personal information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.
3. Disclosure to third parties outside Cricut

At times, Cricut may make certain Personal Information available to strategic partners that work with Cricut to provide products and services, or that help Cricut market to members.

Disclosure to Non-Affiliates for Direct Marketing/Advertising Purposes. We do not, but may in the future, share your Personal Information with non-affiliated third parties so that they may offer, market, and advertise products and services directly to you. If and when that happens, we will provide our members with advance notice and the choice to opt out of such information sharing.

Please note, however, that under no circumstances do we knowingly share your Payment Account Information with non-affiliated third parties for direct marketing and advertising purposes (except with your affirmative prior consent).

Disclosure to Co-Sponsors. From time to time, we may co-sponsor (online and offline) events and/or product/service offerings with non-affiliated third parties. If you participate in such co-sponsored events or offerings, any Personal Information, and User Activity Information we collect from you based on your participation may be shared with our co-sponsors who may use such information for their own marketing and advertising purposes. You must contact our co-sponsors directly in order to opt out of their use of your information for marketing and advertising purposes.

Disclosure to Service Providers. We may disclose your Personal Information and User Activity Information to our outside vendors and contractors who need to access such information in order to perform their services (including, without limitation, transaction/payment processing, financing offers, order fulfillment, survey/contest/sweepstakes administration and prize fulfillment, data research and analysis, data collection and processing, data storage, data security, hosting and technical support for our Site, and marketing and advertising support) to us (hereinafter collectively as “Service Providers”). For example, we may use a marketing firm to conduct online surveys from time to time. We require that our Service Providers use your information shared by us solely for the purposes of performing their services to us and that they maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of such information and not further disclose the information to others.

Disclosure Under Other Circumstances. We may disclose your Personal Information and User Activity Information to others if doing so is required by law or, in our good faith belief, is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with legal process (including a court order or subpoena); (ii) cooperate with law enforcement; (iii) enforce this Privacy Policy and/or the Terms of Use for our Site; (iv) respond to an emergency; or (v) protect the rights, property, or safety of Cricut, one or more members of our users and members, and/or the public.

In addition, we may transfer your Personal Information and User Activity Information as part of our assets if we (or parts of our businesses) are sold or transferred to, merged with, or acquired by a third party. Upon such transfer, the privacy policy of the acquiring entity may govern the further use of your Personal Information and User Activity Information.

Unrestricted Disclosure of Aggregate and Anonymous Information. Given the anonymous, non-personally identifiable nature of such information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy on how we may use or disclose Aggregate and Anonymous Information. For example, we may freely share Aggregate and Anonymous Information with non-affiliated third parties who may use such data for their own marketing, advertising, research, or other business purposes. We may also freely share Aggregate and Anonymous Information with our Service Providers in order for them to perform services to us.

4. Information access – your choices
Information Access. If you wish to update/correct your Personal Information (such as name, address, phone number, or payment information) previously provided to us, you may send your request to us via email at privacyrequest@cricut.com or via postal mail at Cricut, Inc. Attn: Privacy Data Processor, 10855 South River Front Parkway, Suite 300, South Jordan, Utah U.S.A. 84095. We will endeavor to process your request as soon as possible after receipt. Also, if you have an active account on our Site, you may log in to your account to review, update, and correct your account information. For other Personal Information, we will provide you with access for any purpose except as follows; (i) we may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by law.
Your Choices
Opt-Out for Email Marketing. When you register to become a member on our Site or to participate in a Sponsored Activity, we may provide you with the opportunity to opt out of receiving marketing emails from us (e.g., by checking an opt-out box) at the time of your registration. Even if you do not exercise the opt-out choice when you register or when you otherwise disclose your Personal Information to us, you may subsequently exercise such choice at any time, by sending your request to us via email at privacyrequest@cricut.com or via postal mail at Cricut, Inc. Attn: Privacy Data Processor, 10855 South River Front Parkway, Suite 300, South Jordan, Utah U.S.A. 84095, or by using any opt-out means (e.g., an “unsubscribe” link) provided in a marketing email you have previously received from us. Please note, however, that your opt-out will apply only to marketing and promotional emails from us and will not stop email communications from us relating to your Transaction or Request, of a transactional, administrative or relationship nature, or as required by law, such as notice of a material change in this Privacy Policy and/or the Terms of Use for our Site, notice of an actual or suspected security breach that affects your Personal Information stored by or for us, etc.

Please also note that if the email address you provide to us is a “wireless” email address (i.e., the address is designated by a wireless service carrier specifically for transmitting emails to a wireless device), we will not send marketing emails to that address without your prior opt-in consent. The Federal Communications Commission has published a list of domain names used by wireless service providers to transmit emails to wireless devices, at http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/policy/DomainNameDownload.html. Wireless service providers must add new domain names to this list within 30 days of activating them. If your email address contains a domain name on this list (after the “@” symbol), then we will treat your email address as a wireless email address. However, the mere fact that you can retrieve emails from your regular Internet email account on your mobile/wireless device, does not make your Internet email address a “wireless” email address.
Opt-Out for Disclosure to Non-Affiliates for Direct Marketing/Advertising Purposes. We do not currently, but may in the future, share your Personal Information with non-affiliated third parties so that they may offer, market and advertise products and services directly to you. You may at any time opt out of such information sharing, by sending your request to us via email at privacyrequest@cricut.com or via postal mail at Cricut, Inc. Attn: Privacy Data Processor, 10855 South River Front Parkway, Suite 300, South Jordan, Utah U.S.A. 84095. We may also provide you with an opportunity to opt out at the time you register on our Site or to participate in a Sponsored Activity, such as by checking an opt-out box on the registration page.
Cancellation of Account/Deletion of Information. If you wish to cancel your account on our Site and delete your Personal Information previously provided to us, you may send your request to us via email at privacydelete@cricut.com or via postal mail at Cricut, Inc. Attn: Privacy Data Processor, 10855 South River Front Parkway, Suite 300, South Jordan, Utah U.S.A. 84095. We will endeavor to process your request as soon as possible after receipt. However, we reserve the right to retain your Personal Information if doing so is required by law or to comply with legal process (including a court order or subpoena), a legitimate law enforcement need,or for legitimate business purposes.
5. Data Retention

It is our highest priority to protect your personally identifiable information and to only use it in the way our members would expect us to. Your Personal Information is retained to allow for financial transactions and to allow Cricut to provide Sponsored Activities for up to 5 years after you have actively engaged in our Sponsored Activities, or until you request otherwise.

6. How we protect your information

Cricut understands the importance of protecting the security and integrity of Personal Information that our members have shared with us, and will endeavor to safeguard your Personal Information. All Payment Account Information provided by you in connection with an online transaction with our Site will be protected by encryption using the standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, and we retain your Payment Account Information for only as long as is necessary to process your related transactions with us. It is also important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. We urge you to keep your account login information in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone. Also, remember to sign off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library or an Internet cafe. We will endeavor to notify you within 72 hours in the event we become aware of a breach or suspected breach of the security of your Personal Information stored by us.

Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet and no data storage can be 100% secure. Consequently, while Cricut will endeavor to safeguard your Personal Information, it cannot guarantee the absolute security of such information. You understand and agree that Cricut shall not be liable for any breach of the security of your Personal Information resulting from causes or events that are beyond Cricut’s control, including, without limitation, your own act or omission, corruption of storage media, defects in third party data security products or services, power failures, natural phenomena, riots, acts of vandalism, hacking, sabotage, or terrorism. You have a right to know if your Personal Information was stolen due to a breach. We will notify you no later than 72 hours after we become aware of the breach. We note that an inability to determine whether a breach has occurred which is caused by a failure in our internal systems and policies does not excuse a delay in reporting.

Please note that any information that you post in any public, community, or interactive areas on our Site (e.g., chat rooms, bulletin boards, message boards, and discussion groups) will be accessible to, and may be collected and used by, others and may result in unsolicited or unwanted messages or contact from others. Accordingly, please exercise caution when providing information about yourself in any public, community or interactive areas on our Site.

7. Use of cookies & similar tracking technologies

We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies (such as pixel tags and web beacons) as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered Personal Information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as Personal Information.

Cookies. We may send cookies, which are small pieces of data, to your web browser to facilitate your use of our Site. Cookies help us deliver content specific to your interests and permit our servers to recall information from your prior visits to our Site. Cookies are also used to direct members to social ads and initiate emails based on your shopping preferences. We may use information collected from cookies together with Personal Information we have collected from you. We do not, however, use cookies to access information on your computer or device. You can choose whether to accept cookies by adjusting the settings of your browser. If your browser is set to reject cookies, you may still enter our Site, but you may not have full access to all areas within our Site.

Web Beacons. Web beacons are small bits of code embedded in web pages or in emails. We may use web beacons to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited a web page, and to understand usage patterns. We also may include web beacons in emails to learn if messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded. Web beacons cannot be declined when delivered via a regular web page. However, web beacons can be refused when delivered via email. If you do not wish to receive web beacons via email, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select Text only) emails via your email software.

Adobe’s Flash Cookies. The Adobe Flash Player is an application and web tool that allows rapid development of dynamic content. Flash (and similar applications) use technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies but these are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web browser. We may employ Adobe Flash cookies in certain situations where we use Flash to provide some content such as video clips or animation. You may access your Flash management tools from Adobe’s web site directly.

DoubleClick’s Dart Cookies. The DoubleClick DART cookie helps us learn how well our Internet advertising campaigns or paid search listings perform. We may use DoubleClick’s DART technology to deliver and serve advertisements. This information helps to give us and third parties the number of unique users their advertisements were displayed to, how many users click on our Internet ads or paid listings, and which ads or paid listings are clicked on.

Third-Party Advertisements. We also may use third-party advertisements and advertisers on our Site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our Site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

8. Third-party websites and third-party applications

Our Site may (i) contain links to third-party sites; and (ii) include applications that are developed and hosted by third parties that are not owned or controlled by or affiliated with Cricut. Cricut is not responsible for the privacy practices of such third-party sites or applications. Once you enter such a third-party site or enlist such a third-party application, this Privacy Policy will no longer apply, and any information collected from or about you on that third-party site will be governed by the privacy policy of that third-party. The privacy policies and practices of such third-party sites may be substantially different from those of Cricut. They may send their own cookies to you and may collect data about you and make use of that data in ways that we would not. You access such third-party sites and applications entirely at your own risk. You should always read the privacy policy for a third-party site and application before disclosing any Personal Information on such site.

9. Protecting children

Our Site is not designed or intended for children under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 18 on our Site. Children under the age of 18 are not permitted to register on our Site. If we discover that any registration is made by an underage child, such registration will be promptly and permanently canceled and removed from our Site, with or without notice. We urge parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in and monitor the online activities of their children.

10. Your legal rights

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information, including the following:

The right to request access to a copy of the Personal Information we are holding about you
The right to request that the Personal Information we are holding about you be updated/corrected
The right to request erasure of the Personal Information we hold about you
The right to object to our processing of your Personal Information on the basis of our legitimate interests
The right to object to processing for direct marketing
The right to request that your Personal Information be transferred to you or another provider

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us using the details below.

You also have the right to make a complaint to your data protection regulator (in the UK, this will be the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)( www.ico.org.uk ). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO. Please contact us first before escalating your complaint.

11. Changes to privacy policy

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole discretion. For example, we may amend this Privacy Policy in order to address new developments in national, state, or local consumer privacy laws, or to conform to changing industry practices. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will announce and post such changes on our Site for the general public. If you are a registered user, we may also notify you of the changes via email and may ask you to affirmatively consent to and accept the changes at the time of your next account login on our Site. By continuing to use our Site after such notice and consent, you are bound by this Privacy Policy as modified.

12. Our contact information

Should you have questions about this Privacy Policy or our information collection, use and disclosure practices, you may contact us as follows:

privacyrequest@cricut.com or via postal mail at Cricut, Inc., Attn: Privacy Data Processor, 10855 South River Front Parkway, Suite 300, South Jordan, Utah U.S.A. 84095

We will use reasonable efforts to respond promptly to requests, questions, or concerns you may have regarding our use of Personal Information about you. Except where required by law, Cricut cannot ensure a response to questions or comments regarding topics unrelated to this policy or Cricut’s online privacy practices.

i.e., information that would allow someone to identify you or contact you, such as your full name, postal address, e-mail address, or telephone number), as well as information about your use of the Services. Below we describe the different types of information we collect from you and the devices you use when you interact with the Services.

Information you provide to us: Some of the Services may permit you to enter contact information and other information about yourself and others. We collect and store any information you enter through the Services. For example, you may provide:

This information includes information about the devices used to access the Services, such as Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, your device ID and other unique device identifiers, mobile network information, information about how the device is interacting with our Services, hardware model, and the type and version of your device’s operating system or web browser.

Much of this information is collected through cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies. Please see our
Tracking Technologies Notice for further information, including your choices in relation to the use of these technologies.

Information from Social Media Networks and Other Third Parties: When you use certain features of the Services, you may give us permission to access information about you from services offered by third parties, including social media networks. For example, you may choose to register on our websites by using a social media account, or you may use a social media function on our Services such as a “share” button. Doing that allows us to obtain information from the social media platform. That information could include your friends or contacts, profile picture, birth date, gender, people/sites you follow, or other profile-related information, as well as any other information you have opted to share. The information we obtain from social media networks depends on your account/privacy settings with those third parties and those third-parties’ privacy policies, so be sure to check those policies and to adjust your settings to meet your preferences.

We may also obtain information about you from other third-party sources, such as our partners and advertisers, interactive applications offered through our services (such as embedded video players), and commercially available sources such as data aggregators and public databases. We may combine the information we receive from third parties with information we collect through the Services.

Location Information: We collect general information about your location through the Services, such as the city, state, and/or zip code associated with your IP Address. If you agree, we may collect more specific location information that is provided through the GPS functionality on your mobile device used to access the Services. That location information is used to present information and advertising that is of relevance to you in your geographic area and to allow you to take advantage of certain features of the Services such as tailoring live class schedules to your time zone or providing you with local grocery store options for recipe ingredient delivery. If you grant permission for us to collect more specific GPS location information, you can disable such access through your mobile device settings.

Information You Provide About Others: If you send someone else a communication using the Services, such as sending content to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

4. WHEN WE SHARE INFORMATION

We may disclose the information we collect as described below and supplemented by our Tracking Technologies Notice. By accessing and using the Services, you consent to our sharing practices, as described in this Notice, and subject to any choices you have made.

Third-party service providers: We engage third-party service providers to perform a variety of services and functions on our behalf, such as customer support, administering our promotions, marketing or promotional assistance, data analytics, online advertising, technology services and platforms, processing payments, and other services.

The Discovery family of companies: We may share information about you within the family of Discovery companies, including our subsidiary and affiliated companies and joint venture partners, to provide and improve our products and services, as well as to provide you with information about products or services that may interest you.

Sweepstakes, contests & promotions: When you register or enter a promotion, sweepstakes, or contest through our Services, we may share the information you provide for such purposes with authorized third-party service providers (as described above), participating sponsors, and advertising partners. Further, by entering any promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that promotion, which may require you to take certain actions, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing Discovery and/or the sponsor(s) of the promotion to use and publicly release your name, voice, and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the promotion. Please review the relevant promotion, sweepstakes, or contest rules for more information.

Business partners: We may share information with third parties with whom we have business relationships, such as our co-promotional partners, advertisers, ad networks, and data marketing services, for purposes such as offering products and services that may interest you.

Business transfer: In the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganization, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, or a diligence process in connection with a potential business transaction, the information we collect and maintain may be disclosed, sold, or transferred as part of that transaction. If such transfer is subject to additional restrictions under applicable laws, we will comply with such restrictions.

Legal requirements and protection of Services and users: We will disclose the information we collect where we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is: (a) required by law (or to respond to subpoenas, warrants, government requests, or similar process served on us); (b) pursuant to our DMCA notice and take-down policy and procedures; and/or (c) necessary to protect or defend our legal rights or property, our Services, you, or other third parties, or ensure the safety and security of our Services, systems, and of our customers or the general public.

With your consent: We may share or disclose information about you if you ask or authorize us to do so, including by intentionally interacting with third-parties on our sites. Additionally, when you choose to share information in a public forum, that information may be seen or collected by anyone, including third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Notice. We are not responsible for events arising from the distribution of any information you choose to share publicly through our Services.

Aggregate information: We may aggregate and/or de-identify information such that it is no longer linked to you or your device. This Notice does not limit our ability to disclose aggregated or de-identified information that is not linked to you. We may use and disclose such information to our partners, advertisers, and any other third parties in our discretion.

6. CHOICES YOU HAVE REGARDING THE COLLECTION, USE, AND SHARING OF INFORMATION

You have many choices regarding how we use and share your information. These choices are described in more detail below.

Subscription and Registration Services: The Services may include subscription and registration management tools that allow you to make changes regarding your preferences for receiving communications. Regardless of whether these tools are available through the Services, you may contact us as at privacy_policy@discovery.com if you: (a) have questions or comments about this Notice; (b) wish to make corrections to the information you have provided to us; (c) want to opt-out from receiving future commercial correspondence, including e-mails, from us (we may continue to send you transactional messages such as responding to your inquiries or notices of updates to this Notice); or (d) do not want us to share information that identifies you with third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes.

We will respond to your request and, if applicable and appropriate, make the requested change in our active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note:

you may be required to verify your identity to make certain changes;
we may not be able to fulfill certain requests while allowing you access to certain benefits and features of our Services;
it is not always possible to completely change, remove, or delete all information about you from our databases for legal and other reasons; and
we generally do not remove public postings you may have made on the Services, such as in forums or blogs.

E-mail communications: In connection with certain features on the Services, we may allow you to set your preferences for receiving e-mail communications from us (such as agreeing to some communications but not others). In other instances, you may “opt out” of receiving future commercial e-mail communications from us by clicking the “unsubscribe” link or following the other instructions included at the bottom of most e-mails we send, provided, however, we reserve the right to continue to send you transactional e-mails, such as customer service communications and shipping confirmations.

Targeted advertising: To find out more about our advertising and how to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance, please see our Tracking Technologies Notice.

Mobile device location information: If you access the Services through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with specific, GPS location-tracking information, either do not agree to allow your device to share this information with us or disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device. Your device manufacturer should provide instructions on how to disable GPS or other location-tracking functions. If you initially consent to the collection of location information, you can subsequently stop our collection of location information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device or by uninstalling the application from your mobile device.

7. HOW WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

Like many companies, we use cookies and other tracking technologies on our Services. For detailed information about the tracking technologies we use, how we use those technologies, and additional options you have regarding the use of those technologies, please visit our Tracking Technologies Notice. Additionally, as more fully explained in that Tracking Technologies Notice, your browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality. Our information collection and disclosure practices, and the choices that we provide, will continue to operate as described in this Notice and the related Tracking Technologies Notice, whether or not a Do Not Track signal is received.

8. ADDITIONAL PRIVACY INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information regarding the “personal information” (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)) we collect from and about you, and your rights with respect to your personal information. You can find this additional information in our California Privacy Notice .

9. ADDITIONAL PRIVACY INFORMATION FOR NEVADA RESIDENTS

Under Nevada law, Nevada residents who have purchased goods or services from us may opt out of the “sale” of “covered information” (as such terms are defined under Nevada law) for monetary consideration. In some circumstances, we may share your information with certain third parties that we believe can provide you with offers and promotions for products and services of interest to you. This sharing may qualify as a sale under Nevada law. If you are a Nevada resident who has purchased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of “sales” activity emailing us at
privacy_policy@discovery.com. Please note we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request.

10. HOW WE PROTECT CHILDREN’S INFORMATION

Discovery Services are generally directed to adults and not intended for use by children under the age of thirteen (13), we do not allow children to provide their “personal information” (as defined by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act or “COPPA”) on these Services, and we will delete such information in a reasonable period of time if we become aware of it. In some limited cases, Discovery does offer Services that are intended for use by children under thirteen (13); please see the privacy notices posted on those services for more information. If you have any questions about our practices with respect to children’s privacy or to request that we delete personal information provided by your child, please contact us at
privacy_policy@discovery.com.

11. HOW WE MAINTAIN AND SECURE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We maintain the information we collect for as long as necessary to provide the Services, for so as long as reasonably required to satisfy the purpose for which you submitted the information or our business purposes, or as required by law.

We take technical and organizational security measures to protect your information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. However, no method of transmission over the internet, and no means of electronic or physical storage, is absolutely secure. As such, you acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to, through, or on our Services or via the Internet and that any such transmission is at your own risk.

If you create an account or register with any of our Services, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password at all times.

12. THIRD-PARTY SITES, SERVICES, AND FEATURES

Our Services may contain links to third-party websites (e.g., online stores that offer products for purchase), third-party plug-ins (e.g., social-sharing buttons), and third-party features (e.g., banner advertisements). These third-party services may collect information from or about you when you interact with them, and in some cases, they may track your activity, including through the use of cookies or other tracking technologies, without you needing to interact with them. We are not responsible for the content or practices of such third parties, and their collection, use, and disclosure of your information will be subject to their privacy policies, and not this Notice. We urge you to read the privacy and security policies of these third parties.

13. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE

This Notice and all disputes arising hereunder or relating hereto shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to choice of law principles. Those who choose to access the Services from locations outside the United States do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable. By using the Services, you agree that the exclusive jurisdiction for any dispute not subject to any applicable arbitration clause in our Terms of Use or Visitor Agreement shall be the state and federal courts located in New York.

14. UPDATES TO THE NOTICE

We may change this Notice from time to time as our services, technology, and legal obligations change. If we make changes, we will post the updated Notice and revise the “Last Updated” date. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting of the revised Notice, and your continued use of the Services after that date will indicate your consent to any changes, unless applicable law requires us to provide another form of notice and/or seek your agreement to such changes.

California Information & Deletion Rights

If you are a California resident, the CCPA allows you to make certain requests about your personal information. Specifically, the CCPA allows you to request us to:

Inform you about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about you; the categories of
sources of such information, the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information, and
the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal information;
Provide access to and/or a copy of certain personal information we hold about you;
Delete certain personal information we have about you; and
Provide you with information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any.

Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law. For example, we need certain information in order to provide the Services to you.

Verification: We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name, e-mail address, and physical address.

You are also permitted to designate an authorized agent to submit certain requests on your behalf. In order for an authorized agent to be verified, you must provide the authorized agent with signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney. We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorized agent’s request.

If you would like further information regarding your legal rights under California law or would like to exercise any of them, please submit your request using the following intake form:

California Information & Deletion Requests

If you prefer, you may contact us at the following toll-free phone number to make your request: +1-866-324-3637.

For information about the Access, Deletion, and Do Not Sell Opt-Out requests Discovery has received and processed since July 2020 see here.

Notice of Right to Opt-Out of Sale of Personal Information

California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information. Under the CCPA, “sale” is broadly defined to mean the sharing of personal information with third parties who are not acting as our service providers or who are otherwise not restricted from using data only on our behalf or pursuant to an applicable CCPA exception.

In some circumstances, we may share certain of your information with third parties to provide you with offers, promotions, and opportunities that may be of interest to you, which may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. Under the CCPA, “sale” may also include allowing third parties to “collect” certain information, such as IP address, and/or browsing behavior, through cookies and similar technologies, to deliver targeted advertising on the Services or other services. Advertising, including targeted advertising, enables us to provide you certain content for free and allows us to provide you offers relevant to you.

If you would like to opt out of our use of your information for such purposes that are considered a “sale” under California law, you may do so as outlined on the following page: Do Not Sell My Personal Information. Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without legally-required affirmative authorization.

The CCPA further provides you with the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your access, deletion or sale opt out rights.

California “Shine the Light” Disclosure

If a company shares “personal information” (as defined in California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code § 1798.83) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes (e.g., to send offers and information that may be of interest to you), California law requires either providing a mechanism by which consumers can obtain more information about such sharing over the prior calendar year, or providing a mechanism by which consumers can opt out of such sharing. As discussed above, we provide an opt out for this sharing. If you are a California resident and would like to opt out of sharing pursuant to this law, please use the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link above.

A. Introduction

Your service provider is STARY PTE. LTD., a company operating under the laws of Singapore, located at 11 WOODLANDS, CLOSE #08-20, WOODLAND 11, SINGAPORE (737853). We recognizes that your privacy is very important, and we take it seriously. Your privacy and trust are very important to us, and it is our commitment to being transparent about the use of collected information.

This Privacy Policy describes STARY’s policies and procedures on the collection, use, disclosure, and sharing of your personal information or personal data, and the choices you can make about how we use this information when you access or use our Site, Application, and/or Services.

Note that STARY’s Terms of Service  apply to this Privacy Policy. By accessing or using the STARY website and application, you are consenting that you unconditionally accept this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms found on this Privacy Policy, please do not use the STARY Services.

THIS PRIVACY POLICY IS IMPORTANT. WE HOPE YOU WILL TAKE THE TIME TO READ IT CAREFULLY.

B. Age restrictions

STARY is not intended for children. Children under the age of 13 must not use our Site, Application, and/or Services for any purpose. STARY will never knowingly solicit or accept personally identifiable information or other content from a user or visitor who STARY knows is under 13 years of age. If STARY discovers that a user under 13 years of age has created an account, or that a user or visitor under 13 years of age has posted personally identifiable information or other content to the Service, STARY will terminate the account and remove the information or other content.

Users between 13 and 18 (each a “Teen”) may not access or use the Service unless (i) both the Teen and their parent or legal guardian have first agreed to these Terms of Service; and (ii) the Teen uses an account established by their parent or legal guardian, under such parent or guardian’s supervision, and with such parent or guardian’s permission.  If you permit a Teen to use the Services, you hereby agree to these Terms of Service on behalf of both yourself and the Teen. You further agree that you are solely responsible for any and all use of the Service by your Teen regardless of whether such use was authorized by you.

C. Data Collection

We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services– from figuring out basic stuff such as which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the author who matter most to you online or which stories you might like.

When you interact with our Site, Application, and/or Services, we collect information that could be used to identify you (“Personal Data”). Some of the information we collect is stored in a manner that cannot be linked back to you (“Non-Personal Data”).

When you log in, we collect information that we store with your account (typically your nickname, email address, and a password for your account), which we treat as personal information. This log information may include but not limited to your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your query and cookie data. If you log into STARY with a social networking credential, such as with a third-party account, we will ask permission to access basic information from that account, such as your name and email address. You can stop sharing that information with us at any time by removing STARY’s access to that account. When you do not log in to our services, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the application and device you’re using. This collection helps us do things such as maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.

We collect your payment information if you are a paying customer. This information is required to complete a commercial transaction on our Applications and our Sites. We use this information to enable and fulfill your transaction. If you choose to use any third-party’s service to finalize and pay for your order, you will provide your credit card number directly to the third-party. The privacy policy of the third-party will apply to the information you provide on its website.

If you choose to participate in our survey, we may request certain Information (including Personal Data and Non-Personal Data) from you, and this information will be used to provide personalized help and instructions. `

The information we collect and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.

D. Use of your data

STARY uses your data as necessary to perform our contract with you and for our legitimate business interests. The purpose of processing and using your data is listed below:

To help us provide and administer our Site, Application, and/or Services, authenticate users for security purposes, provide personalized user features and access, process transactions, conduct research, develop new features, and improve the features, algorithms, and usability of our Site, Application, and/or Services.
To communicate with you about your use of our Site, Application, and/or Services, product announcements, and software updates, as well as respond to your requests for assistance, including providing account verification support if you’re having difficulty accessing your account.
To send you direct marketing information and special offers about our products and services through inbox messages. If you do not want to receive any above-mentioned messages, please contact us through contact@dreame.com at the time you create your account or any point thereafter.
To display User Content associated with your account and make sure it is available to you when you use our Services.
To calculate aggregate statistics on the number of unique devices using our Site, Application, and/or Services, and detect and prevent fraud and misuse of those.
To analyze what features or actions are taken within our Site, Application, and/or Service to improve your experience.
To verify parental and guardian consent to use STARY by an underage minor through a payment procedure.
To facilitate your purchases within our Site, Application, and/or Service and validate your real name to facilitate the creation of your Pay account.

F. Information Sharing

a. Shared information on our Site, Application, and/or Services

Any information that you include in your publicly-visible STARY profile, which may include your profile ID, nickname, photo and your personal introduction will be shared on our Site, Application, and/or Services to maintain your account in accordance with your instructions and requests.

b. Sharing Your Data outside of our Site, Application, and/or Services

Some STARY-related features allow you to provide Shared Information to those outside of your STARY network. For example, publicly accessible blogs and forums, or certain social media features within STARY (such as ""plug-ins"" (which create a direct link between two websites)) allow you to re-post and disclose Shared Information. If you share information using these features, third parties unrelated to us may be able to see and use it.

The information we share with such a third party is described to you when you first use that service or feature, and we require that the third party provide the same or equal protection of user data as stated in this policy. You can control which third parties have access to this information in your account. You can withdraw your agreement to the sharing of that information at any time by following the instructions set out here. Please note that if you ask us not to share that information with the third party, you may no longer be able to use that service or feature. We are not responsible for any third party use of any Information provided by you to them.

We do not rent or sell your personal information to other companies or individuals unless we have your consent.

G. Information Security

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or data destruction.

We restrict access to your personal information to our staff who need to know that information to operate, develop or improve our services.

H. Updating your Information

We provide mechanisms for updating and correcting your personally identifying information and non-personal information for many of our services.

You also have the right to access personal information we hold about you, how we use it, and who we share it with. You also have the right to correct that information.

You can access and correct your personal information by logging into your account at any time.

I. Deletion of your data

You can request deletion of your data at any time by contact us at contact@dreame.com . We will evaluate such requests on a case by case basic. We may keep some of your data for as long as reasonably necessary for our legitimate business interests, including fraud detection and prevention and to comply with our legal obligations including tax, legal reporting, and auditing obligations. Sometimes, your request will only be satisfied by closing your account.

You have the ability to delete your Account, and you should understand that upon deletion of your Account, you will lose the right to access or use all or part of the Platform.

J. Changes to this policy

We change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We always indicate the date when the last changes were published and we offer access to archived versions for your review. If changes are significant, we’ll provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, inbox notification of Privacy Policy changes). Such changes will be used for any and all the information provided by those who have visited, used, or accessed the Service at the time they created their account or any point thereafter. Please note that, by accessing or using the STARY Platform, you are consenting that you unconditionally accept the updated Privacy Policy.

K. Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Platforms

They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure their advertisements’ effectiveness and personalize the advertising content you see.

STARY does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.

You should consult these third-party ad servers or ad networks’ respective privacy policies for more information on their practices and instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices.

Dropbox Privacy Policy

Posted: October 29, 2021

Effective: January 14, 2022

You can see the previous Privacy Policy here.

Thanks for using Dropbox! Here we describe how we collect, use, and handle your personal data when you use our websites, software, and services (“Services”). For more information and details, please see our Frequently Asked Questions page.

What & Why

We collect and use the following information to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services.

Account information. We collect, and associate with your account, the information you provide to us when you do things such as sign up for your account, upgrade to a paid plan, and set up two-factor authentication (like your name, email address, phone number, payment info, and physical address).

Your Stuff. Our Services are designed as a simple and personalized way for you to store your files, documents, photos, comments, messages, and so on (“Your Stuff”), collaborate with others, and work across multiple devices and services. To make that possible, we store, process, and transmit Your Stuff as well as information related to it. This related information includes your profile information that makes it easier to collaborate and share Your Stuff with others, as well as things like the size of the file, the time it was uploaded, collaborators, and usage activity.

Contacts. You may choose to give us access to your contacts to make it easy for you, and your Dropbox Business team (collectively, “Dropbox Business Team”), if you’re a Dropbox Business Team user, to do things like share and collaborate on Your Stuff, send messages, and invite others to use the Services. If you do, we’ll store those contacts on our servers.

Usage information. We collect information related to how you use the Services, including actions you take in your account (like sharing, editing, viewing, creating and moving files or folders). We use this information to provide, improve, and promote our Services, and protect Dropbox users. Please refer to our FAQ for more information about how we use this usage information.

Device information. We also collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services. This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services. For example, we use device information to detect abuse and identify and troubleshoot bugs.

Cookies and other technologies. We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services. If our systems receive a DNT:1 signal from your browser, we’ll respond to that signal as outlined here. We may also use third-party service providers that set cookies and similar technologies to promote Dropbox services. You can learn more about how cookies and similar technologies work, as well as how to opt out of the use of them for advertising purposes, here.

Marketing. We give users the option to use some of our Services free of charge. These free Services are made possible by the fact that some users upgrade to one of our paid Services. If you register for our Services, we will, from time to time, send you information about upgrades when permissible. Users who receive these marketing materials can opt out at any time. If you don’t want to receive a particular type of marketing material from us, click the ‘unsubscribe’ link in the corresponding emails, or update your preferences in the Notifications section of your personal account.

We sometimes contact people who don’t have a Dropbox account. For recipients in the EU, we or a third party will obtain consent before reaching out. If you receive an email and no longer wish to be contacted by Dropbox, you can unsubscribe and remove yourself from our contact list via the message itself.

Bases for processing your data. We collect and use the personal data described above in order to provide you with the Services in a reliable and secure manner. We also collect and use personal data for our legitimate business needs. To the extent we process your personal data for other purposes, we ask for your consent in advance or require that our partners obtain such consent. For more information on the lawful bases for processing your data, please see our FAQ.

For more details on the categories of personal information that are included in the information above, please see our FAQ.

With Whom

We may share information as discussed below, but we won’t sell it to advertisers or other third parties.

Others working for and with Dropbox. Dropbox uses certain trusted third parties (for example, providers of customer support and IT services) for the business purposes of helping us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. These third parties will access your information to perform tasks on our behalf, and we’ll remain responsible for their handling of your information per our instructions. For a list of trusted third parties that we use to process your personal data and more details on the categories of personal information that we’ve disclosed, please see our FAQ.

Other Dropbox Companies. Dropbox shares infrastructure, systems, and technology with other Dropbox Companies to provide, improve, protect, and promote Dropbox Company Services. We process your information across the Dropbox Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies. For more information on Dropbox Companies, Dropbox Company Services, and how your data is used, please see our FAQ.

Other users. Our Services are designed to help you collaborate with others. If you register your Dropbox account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer or organization, join a Dropbox Business Team, or collaborate with other Dropbox users, we may suggest you or your team as a potential collaborator to other users or teams. For example, if you interact with a person at a company, and that person frequently works with one of their coworkers, we may suggest you as a potential collaborator for that coworker. Collaborators and potential collaborators may see some of your basic information, like your name, Dropbox Business Team name, profile picture, device, email address, and usage information. This helps you sync up with teams you can join and helps other users share files and folders with you.

Certain features let you make additional information available to others.

Other applications. You can choose to connect your Dropbox account with third-party services––for example, via Dropbox APIs. By doing so, you’re enabling Dropbox and those third parties to exchange information about you and data in your account so that Dropbox and those third parties can provide, improve, protect, and promote their services. Please remember that third parties’ use of your information will be governed by their own privacy policies and terms of service.

Business Team Admins. If you are a user of a Dropbox Business Team, your administrator may have the ability to access and control your Dropbox Business Team account. Please refer to your organization’s internal policies if you have questions about this. If you aren’t a Dropbox Business Team user but interact with a Dropbox Business Team user (for example, by joining a shared folder or accessing stuff shared by that user), members of that organization may be able to view information about you (such as your name, email address, and profile picture) and your interaction with the Dropbox Business Team user (such as your IP address). If you share Your Stuff with a Dropbox Business Team user, the administrator of the team account may have the ability to access and edit what you share.

Law & Order and the Public Interest. We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or appropriate government request; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Dropbox or our users; (d) protect Dropbox’s rights, property, safety, or interest; or (e) perform a task carried out in the public interest.

Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility that we embrace. We believe that your data should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it’s stored on our Services or on your home computer’s hard drive. We’ll abide by the following Government Request Principles when receiving, scrutinizing, and responding to government requests (including national security requests) for your data:

Be transparent
Fight blanket requests
Protect all users, and
Provide trusted services.

We publish a Transparency Report as part of our commitment to informing you about when and how governments ask us for information. This report details the types and numbers of requests we receive from law enforcement. We encourage you to review our Government Request Principles and Transparency Report for more detailed information on our approach and response to government requests.

How

Security. We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities. We continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things like two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and alerts when new devices and apps are linked to your account. We deploy automated technologies to detect abusive behavior and content that may harm our Services, you, or other users.

User Controls. You can access, amend, download, and delete your personal information by logging into your Dropbox account and going to your account settings page. Learn more here about managing your account information generally, or click here to learn how to change your profile information.

Retention. When you sign up for an account with us, we’ll retain information you store on our Services for as long as your account exists or as long as we need it to provide you the Services. If you delete your account, we’ll initiate deletion of this information after 30 days. Learn more here. But please note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers and back-up storage; and (2) we may retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.

Where

Around the world. To provide you with the Services, we may store, process, and transmit data in the United States and locations around the world—including those outside your country. Data may also be stored locally on the devices you use to access the Services.

Data Transfers. When transferring data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, Dropbox relies upon a variety of legal mechanisms, such as contracts with our customers and affiliates, Standard Contractual Clauses, and the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable.

EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield. Dropbox complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss–U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union, the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States, although Dropbox does not rely on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as a legal basis for transfers of personal data. Dropbox has certified to the Department of Commerce that it, and its subsidiary JN Projects Inc. d/b/a HelloSign, adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. You can also learn more about Privacy Shield at https://www.privacyshield.gov.

Dropbox is subject to oversight by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. JAMS is the US-based independent organization responsible for reviewing and resolving complaints about our Privacy Shield compliance—free of charge to you. We ask that you first submit any such complaints directly to us via privacy@dropbox.com. If you aren’t satisfied with our response, please contact JAMS at https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield. In the event your concern still isn’t addressed by JAMS, you may be entitled to a binding arbitration under Privacy Shield and its principles.

Your Control and Access of Your Data

You have control over your personal data and how it’s collected, used, and shared. For example, you can:

Delete Your Stuff in your Dropbox account. You can learn more about how to delete files saved on Dropbox here.
Change or correct personal data. You can manage your account and the content contained in it, as well as edit some of your personal data, through your account settings page.
Access and take your data elsewhere. You can access your personal data from your Dropbox account and you can download a copy of Your Stuff in a machine readable format as outlined here. You can also ask us for a copy of personal data you provided to us or that we’ve collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting it, the types of sources we got it from, and types of third parties we’ve shared it with.
Object to the processing of your personal data. Depending on the processing activity, you can request that we stop or limit processing of your personal data.

If you would like to submit a data access request or object to the processing of your personal data, please email us at privacy@dropbox.com. To request that your personal data be deleted, please fill out this form. For more information on how to control and access your personal data, please see our FAQ.

Dropbox as controller or processor. If you reside in North America (the United States, Canada, and Mexico), Dropbox, Inc. acts as your service provider. For all other users, Dropbox International Unlimited Company acts as a controller of your personal data. If you are a Dropbox Business or Education customer outside of North America, Dropbox acts as a processor of your data.

Changes

If we’re involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition, or sale of our assets, your data may be transferred as part of that deal. We’ll notify you (for example, via a message to the email address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you.

General

At Duolingo, we care about your personal data, so we have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use and share it.

This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) details the personal data Duolingo, Inc. (“Duolingo”, “we”, “us” or “our”) receives about you, how we process it and your rights and obligations in relation to your personal data. Duolingo, Inc., a company registered at 5900 Penn Ave, Second Floor, Pittsburgh, PA 15206, United States of America is the data controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and any relevant local legislation (“Data Protection Laws”).

By using or accessing the Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Capitalized terms not defined here have the meanings set forth in the terms and conditions (the “Terms and Conditions”), located at www.duolingo.com/terms. We may update our Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we do this and the changes are material, we will post a notice that we have made changes to this Privacy Policy on the Website for at least 7 days before the changes are made, and we will indicate the date these terms were last revised at the bottom of the Privacy Policy. Any revisions to this Privacy Policy will become effective at the end of that 7 day period.

If you are an employee, worker or contractor of Duolingo, the information about how we handle your personal information is available in the Duolingo internal knowledge base. With respect to employees based in Europe, we are committed to cooperating with European data protection authorities (DPAs) and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources data transferred from Europe in the context of the employment relationship.

Information We Collect

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and share your personal data.

Information you provide

Through the registration process, you will provide us with your name, e-mail address (or parent’s e-mail address), and age or date of birth. You will also provide us with your payment transaction information if you choose to pay for Duolingo services.

Activity Data

When you use the Service, you will submit information and content to your profile. We will also generate data about your use of our Services including your engagement in educational activities on the Service, or your sending of messages and otherwise transmitting information to other users (“Activity Data”). We also collect technical data about how you interact with our Services; for more information, see Cookies.

When you use Duolingo in our app or on our website, we use a service named FullStory to log your activity. This provides us with a set of data and a session replay of your activity on Duolingo in the form of a video. FullSory captures and analyzes your usage data to help us make your Duolingo experience better.

We only collect the data we need which means we don’t record:
Usernames

Email addresses
Locations or bios on the Profile page
Passwords

We do record the following data:

Live Speaking Practice

When you take a Live Speaking Lesson, we will use your computer's microphone throughout the lesson to speak to your tutor. You also have the option of using your camera to share your video with your tutor. Duolingo records these audio and video lessons and retains them until you close your Duolingo account. Duolingo uses this data to help improve the quality of the lessons and for internal research purposes.

Duolingo does not share any of your personal data with your tutor. You are completely anonymous to them by default, and you can freely choose whether you show them your video or tell them any personal details such as your name during the conversation. Duolingo only shares some basic skill level information with the tutor, prior to your lesson, so they understand how best to speak to you.

Speaking Challenges

Some lessons involve you speaking into the app. To recognize speech your audio may be sent to a third party provider such as Google, Apple, or Amazon Web Services. We may ask you to allow Duolingo to collect and analyze your speech data to help us understand the effectiveness of our lessons, and to improve the product. If you choose not to share your audio with us, or if we haven’t asked you yet, then your audio will not be used in this way. Any audio you agree to send to Duolingo is anonymized when it reaches our servers to ensure that no trace of your personal data remains attached to the audio.

Test Data

If you register for the Duolingo English Test, you will also provide us with your gender, native language, secondary school, and self-reported test scores for other exams. Each time you take a test you must also provide a photo of a current, valid driver’s license, passport, or other government issued ID and take a photo of your face to verify your identity (“Testing ID”).

When you use the Service to take an examination in the Duolingo English Test you must provide access to your computer’s webcam and microphone. We will use them to record you and your screen during the entire examination period (“Testing Video”). From the collected data, Duolingo and/or its trusted third-parties may extract biometric signals for the use of identity verification. While using the Duolingo English Test, you will submit answers to questions and other information as part of the testing and evaluation process.

The testing software will be installed onto your computer. During the test, the testing software will monitor if additional applications or processes are running on your computer, but will not open any applications or individual files. Please close any other applications by exiting from them completely prior to starting the test.

Additionally, Duolingo will be able to note if any peripherals are used during the test (i.e. external devices attached to your computer), but will not have any control or access to these peripherals. Please remove these before testing if you do not wish to have their presence known.

Duolingo will not open network packets, but will have access to network usage statistics and the volume of network traffic.

Third Party Data

We also collect information about you from third parties. For more information, see Information obtained by Third Parties.

Product Research and Development

We may contact you to participate in product research activities. These may include surveys, interviews, and other types of feedback sessions. When you participate in these research activities, the information you provide will be used to test, improve, and develop our products. We will record the video, audio and text transcriptions of this feedback together with any additional contact information you provide and will retain this data for two years.

Please contact us at research@duolingo.com to:

Request more information about the research activities you have volunteered for.
Opt out of being contacted for research activities.
Request a copy of any research related data you have provided to us.
Cookies

When you enter the Website, we collect your browser type and your IP address (a unique address that identifies your computer on the Internet). When you use our mobile Application, we collect your device type, your device ID, and your IP address.

In addition, we store certain information from your browser using ""cookies."" A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, you should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you certain features available on the Website (e.g., customized delivery of information).

You can find more information about cookies and how to manage them at http://www.allaboutcookies.org.

You can see a list of all cookies used at Duolingo on our Cookie List page or manage your cookies in the Privacy Preference Center.

Information Obtained by Third Parties

To support and enhance the Service, we work with a variety of third party advertising networks, marketing analytics service providers and website analysis firms, such as Google, Facebook, Oath, and Unity (collectively, “Third Party Advertising Service Providers”). These Third Party Advertising Service Providers collect and use personal data about your visits to and use of the Website and mobile Application, as well as other websites in order to serve you with advertisements and content tailored to meet your preferences and likely interests or better understand ad effectiveness. Aggregate demographic and interest data will also be used for market research purposes.

We use Google Analytics which is a web analytics tool that helps us understand how users engage with the Website. Like many services, Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track user interactions as in our case, where they are used to collect information about how users use our site. This information is used to compile reports and to help us improve our Website. The reports disclose website trends without identifying individual visitors. You can opt out of Google Analytics without affecting how you visit our site – for more information on opting out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites you use, visit this Google page: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

You can opt-out of receiving personalized ads from advertisers and ad networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or who follow the DAA Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising using their respective opt-out tools. The NAI's opt-out tool can be found here http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ and the DAA's opt out tool can be found here http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.

In addition, your mobile devices may offer settings that enable you to make choices about the collection, use, or transfer of mobile app information for online behavioral advertising (for example, Apple iOS’ Advertising ID and Google Android’s Advertising ID). Please note that opting out does not prevent the display of all advertisements to you.

Use of information obtained by Duolingo

Duolingo may occasionally send you service related and product change announcements through the general operation of the Service. We will send you reminder notifications to support the Duolingo teaching methodology by reinforcing the learning cadence and help maintain your learning streak. We process your data to help provide you with the Service and offer personalized features, to understand and improve our Service and to keep our Service safe and secure.

Duolingo may use or share anonymous data collected through the Service, including Activity Data without limitation. As a business, it is critical that we perform our contract with you with the best service possible, and it is in our legitimate interests to perform these processing functions and to enable service e-mails by default to keep your data secure and provide our Service. You may opt out of any non-essential service e-mails at any time.

We may also use your contact information to send you notifications regarding new services, offers and promotions offered by Duolingo if you affirmatively consent to receive such communications.

When you register with Duolingo, some of your information is made public and available at various locations including duolingo.com/profile/your-username and duolingo.com/users/your-username. This will include the data from your Duolingo Profile and Account (Name, Location, Bio, Username, User ID, Profile picture and Duolingo Plus membership status); your followers and the people you follow; and your learning progress (XP, Streak, Lingots, Daily Progress, Languages being learned, progress level, Crowns, Skills, Lessons undertaken, Lexemes and Strength). Tinycards decks you create are also public by default, but can be made visible to only you or to people you have shared a link with. Your Duolingo account email address is not shown publicly. Third party websites may be able to read, collect and use your public information for their own purposes.

Profile information is used by Duolingo to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the Service and to be presented to other users. In some cases, other users may be able to supplement your profile, including by submitting comments (which can be deleted by you). Duolingo uses this information to provide you with support, to send you essential notifications, to enforce our terms, conditions and policies, to communicate with you, to administer the Services, and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical, and survey purposes. Duolingo’s Terms and Conditions provide the contractual lawful basis for these processing activities.

Duolingo English Test

When you take a test in the Duolingo English Test, we will use your computer's camera and microphone throughout the test to collect a Testing Video.

We will process information in connection with the Duolingo English Test comprising given name(s), surname(s), date of birth, gender, native language, country, secondary school, self-reported test scores for other exams, application IDs, a picture or scan of a current, valid driver’s license, passport or other government issued ID, your Testing ID, Testing Video, biometric signals extracted from collected data, data about active software processes, information on connected external peripherals, and volume of network traffic, and answers to questions as part of the testing and evaluation process in order:

To provide accurate testing results to Score Recipient(s) (as defined below)
To compare your Testing ID to your Testing Video to ensure that the person who registered for the examination (and whose identity Duolingo has validated) is the same person who took the examination. In addition, this comparison may be carried out on biometric signals that have been extracted from collected data.
To store and review the Testing Video recording, the active software processes and the volume of network traffic to validate that you took the examination without improper assistance
To evaluate your performance on the Duolingo English Test, to report results and to evaluate the usefulness, accuracy and other aspects of the Duolingo English Test
For our research team to validate and improve the examination, in an anonymized format
To analyze audio recordings of verbal responses to improve our ability to understand the spoken language
To share your Testing ID with your consent upon initiation of a dispute by a Score Recipient

Duolingo’s Terms and Conditions provide the contractual lawful basis for these English Test processing activities.

Duolingo ABC

Duolingo ABC is separate from the traditional Duolingo Learning app and does not share any account information between the two. The Duolingo ABC app is designed to be set up by parents and will ask you to provide your child’s age. This information is kept anonymously for research purposes and not tied to your personal data in any way. You can then choose to enable speaking exercises. Speech data is stored on your phone and uses Apple’s speech recognition service to convert your voice into text. No speech data is shared with Duolingo. As a parent you also have the option of providing your email address so that Duolingo may send you information about product updates and to ask you about participating in product research. If you do provide your email address you can unsubscribe any time by emailing literacy-feedback@duolingo.com or by clicking the unsubscribe link in any Duolingo ABC emails. Your Duolingo ABC data is backed up into Apple’s iCloud which allows you to synchronize and restore the data onto another Apple device.

Sharing your personal data with third parties

Duolingo shares your personal data only when it is necessary to offer the Service, legally required, or permitted by you.

We will provide personal data to hosting providers such as Amazon Web Services, search engine providers such as Google, analytics providers such as Crashlytics, and support providers such as ZenDesk.

These data processors help us bring you the Service. For example, we may share your information in order to detect where or how you encountered a bug when using our mobile application. In connection with these operations, our service providers will have access to personal data for a limited time. When we utilize service providers for processing any personal data, we implement contractual protections limiting the use of that personal data to the provision of services to Duolingo.

We will be required to access and disclose personal data in response to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. Additionally, we will access and share account or other personal data when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Service or using the Duolingo name, or to prevent imminent harm. This will include accessing and sharing personal data with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.

Duolingo will share the complete and accurate results of Duolingo English Tests with such institutions, including universities, potential employers, or other third parties, (collectively, “Score Recipients”) as specified when you send your results after finishing a test or when you apply a coupon sponsored by the Score Recipient before starting a test. These results will include your test score, a video of the interview section of your test, and your written responses to certain parts of the test. We will also share your full name, date of birth, e-mail address, and the photo you take of yourself. We will never share examination results with any party without your approval, except that anonymized examination results will be used by Duolingo and its partners to improve the examination and for research and analysis. We will not share your Testing ID with any Score Recipients, except with your consent upon initiation of a dispute by a Score Recipient.

If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Duolingo business, or individual business units or assets owned by Duolingo that are related to the Service, were to change, your personal data will be transferred to the new owner. In any such transfer of information, your personal data would remain subject to this section.

Duolingo will share aggregate or anonymous data collected through the Service, including Activity Data, for purposes such as understanding or improving the service.

Data subject rights and data retention

You can manage your account settings at https://www.duolingo.com/settings/account to update, amend, and correct your information.

You also have the following rights in relation to the personal data we hold about you, unless provided otherwise by local law:

To request access to, or erasure of, the personal data we hold about you.
To request us to restrict the processing of the personal data we hold about you.
To object to us processing personal data relating to you.
Where you have given us consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.
To export the personal data you have provided to Duolingo in a format that can be transferred electronically to a third party.
To delete your account with Duolingo by following the instructions available through the Service.

Duolingo will retain your data until your account is deleted, after which point we will retain anonymous data collected through the Service, including Activity Data, which may be used by Duolingo and shared with third parties in any manner. Information associated with the Duolingo English Test, including examination results and your Testing Video, will be collectively deleted from your Duolingo account after five years have passed from the date you upload your test, but anonymized examination data, including your examination results and Testing Video, will be kept indefinitely by Duolingo to improve the examination and for research and analysis.

Please note that some of these rights are not absolute. In some cases, we may refuse a request to exercise particular rights if complying with it meant that we are no longer able to meet our contractual obligation to provide you with particular products and services. We will keep you informed as to the actions that we can take when you make your request.

You may also have the right to make a GDPR complaint to the relevant Supervisory Authority. A list of EEA Supervisory Authorities is available here: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm and the UK here: https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/. If you need further assistance regarding your rights, please contact us using the contact information provided below and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable law. In some cases our ability to uphold these rights for you may depend upon our obligations to process personal information for security, safety, fraud prevention reasons, compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or because processing is necessary to deliver the services you have requested. Where this is the case, we will inform you of specific details in response to your request.

Third party websites and links

Please note that you may have cookies placed on your computer by third party websites that refer you to our Service. Although we do not share your personal data with these third party websites unless it is reasonably necessary to offer the Service, they may be able to link certain non-personally identifiable information we transfer to them with personal data they previously collected from you. Please review the privacy policies of each website you visit to better understand their privacy practices. In addition, Duolingo would like to inform you that anytime you click on links (including advertising banners), which take you to third party websites, you will be subject to the third parties’ privacy policies.

Our Services contain links to other sites operated by third parties. Duolingo does not control such other sites and is not responsible for their content, their privacy policies, or their use of personal data, including any personal or financial information collected by our third party payment processor to process payments for in-app purchases. Duolingo’s inclusion of such links does not imply any endorsement of the content on such sites or of their owners or operators except as disclosed on the Services. Any information submitted by you directly to these third parties is subject to that third party’s privacy policy.

California privacy rights

Residents of California have the right to:

Know what personal information we collect about you and from where we collect it.
Access a copy of the personal information we hold about you.
Understand how we process your personal information and how it may be shared.
Opt out of having your personal information shared with certain third parties.
Request we delete your Duolingo account and personal information.

To make such a request, please send an email to privacy@duolingo.com.

Children under age of digital consent

We know that children deserve extra privacy protection. That’s why we treat child users differently to ensure their parents are in control and we only collect the bare minimum information we need to make Duolingo work.

When a user creates a Duolingo account we collect their age and compare it to the local standard of child online consent depending on the country they registered in. We refer to users under this age as “child users”. Child users are permitted to create a user account but we ask them to provide their parent’s email address instead of their own. We also prevent child users from supplying their own name because we don’t need that information.

After registration we will send an email notifying the parent about Duolingo’s privacy and information practices regarding child users, including what personal data we collect and how we use, share, and protect that personal data. The email also explains how parents can request that Duolingo access, change or delete the personal data about their child.

Child users receive the following special treatment:

Lessons are made age appropriate by removing mature words like “beer” or “wine”.
Advertisements are set to family safe content.
The Profile page is hidden, preventing the child from stating their name, location or bio.
Uploading an avatar photo is disabled.
Promotional emails are disabled.
Leaderboards are disabled.
Discussion forums are disabled.
The child’s profile is made private and hidden from other users’ searches.
Other users are unable to follow the child.
The ability to follow other users or search for other users is disabled.
The ability to send an invitation email is disabled.
Finding friends on Facebook is disabled.
Social logins with Facebook, Google or Apple are disabled.
Social follow buttons for Twitter, Facebook and Instagram are disabled.

In addition, all users under the age of 16 receive the following special treatment:

Advertisements are set to non-personalised.
Third party behavioral tracking is disabled.
Third party analytics is disabled.

To prevent restricted users from amending these features, the settings will be hidden or grayed out. In the future, once we’re sure the user is old enough we will automatically remove the restrictions, reset the settings to their defaults and make the settings visible for them to configure how they choose.

With regards to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (""COPPA""), Duolingo only collects personal information from children under the age of 13 for the sole purpose of performing internal operations of the Service. If we discover that we have unknowingly collected additional personal information from these children we will delete it. If you believe this to be the case, please contact us at privacy@duolingo.com.

Links

The Service may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. We encourage users to be aware when they leave the Service to read the privacy statements of other websites that collect personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by Duolingo via the Service.

Information security

Duolingo has implemented administrative and technical safeguards it believes are appropriate to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your personal data, Testing ID, User Photo, access credentials, and Duolingo English Test results. However, given sufficient resources, a determined attacker could defeat those safeguards and may, as a result, gain access to the data we seek to protect.

Do Not Track

The Service is not designed to respond to “do not track” signals sent by some browsers.

Last Update: August 16, 2021

 

(You can find the earlier versions in our archive.)

We believe that transparency is the key to any healthy relationship. At Fitbit, we’re all about healthy. We appreciate that you are trusting us with information that is important to you, and we want to be transparent about how we use it.

 

Here we describe the privacy practices for our devices, applications, software, websites, APIs, products, and services (the “Services”). You will learn about the data we collect, how we use it, the controls we give you over your information, and the measures we take to keep it safe.

Who We Are and How To Contact Us
INFORMATION WE COLLECT


 

When you use our Services, we collect the following types of information.

 

INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US

 

ACCOUNT INFORMATION

Some information is required to create an account on our Services, such as your name, email address, password, date of birth, gender, height, weight, and in some cases your mobile telephone number. This is the only information you have to provide to create an account with us. You may also choose to provide other types of information, such as a profile photo, biography, country information, and community username.

 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

To help improve your experience or enable certain features of the Services, you may choose to provide us with additional information, like your logs for food, weight, sleep, water, or female health tracking; an alarm; and messages on discussion boards or to your friends on the Services.

 

You may also connect with friends on the Services or invite friends who have not yet joined by providing their email addresses, accessing social networking accounts, or using the contact list on your mobile device. We do not store your contact list and delete it after it is used for adding contacts as friends.

 

If you contact us or participate in a survey, contest, or promotion, we collect the information you submit such as your name, contact information, and message.

 

PAYMENT AND CARD INFORMATION

Some Fitbit devices support payments and transactions with third parties. If you activate this feature, you must provide certain information for identification and verification, such as your name, credit, debit or other card number, card expiration date, and CVV code. This information is encrypted and sent to your card network, which upon approval sends back to your device a token, which is a set of random digits for engaging in transactions without exposing your card number. For your convenience, we store the last four digits of your card number and your card issuer’s name and contact information. You can remove the token from your account using your account settings. We do not store your transaction history.

 

If you purchase Fitbit merchandise on our website, you provide your payment information, including your name, credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address. We do not store this payment information. We store your shipping address to fulfill your order. Note that third-party payment processors may retain this information in accordance with their own privacy policies and terms.

 

LIVE COACHING SERVICES

Our live coaching services are a platform for you to communicate with a live health, fitness, or wellness coach (“Live Coaching Services”). Coaches may be provided by third parties, such as your employer or insurance company, or by our third-party coaching service providers. If you use our Live Coaching Services, we collect information about such use, including the plan, goals, and actions you record with your coach, your calendar events, communications with your coach, notes your coach records about you, and other information submitted by you or your coach.

 

INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES

 

DEVICE INFORMATION

Your device collects data to estimate a variety of metrics like the number of steps you take, your distance traveled, calories burned, weight, heart rate, sleep stages, active minutes, and location. The data collected varies depending on which device you use. Learn more about the features of our various devices and how you can use MobileTrack. When your device syncs with our applications or software, data recorded on your device is transferred from your device to our servers.

 

GEOLOCATION INFORMATION

The Services include features that use precise geolocation data, including GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, and cell tower IDs. We collect this type of data if you grant us access to your location. You can always remove our access using your Fitbit device or mobile device settings. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.

 

USAGE INFORMATION

When you access or use our Services, we receive certain usage or network activity information. This includes information about your interaction with the Services, for example, when you view or search content, install applications or software, create or log into your account, pair your device to your account, or open or interact with an application on your Fitbit device.

 

We also collect data about the devices and computers you use to access the Services, including IP addresses, browser type, language, operating system, Fitbit or mobile device information (including device and application identifiers), the referring web page, pages visited, location (depending on the permissions you have granted us), and cookie information.

 

INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES

 

If you choose to connect your account on our Services to your account on another service, we may receive information from the other service. For example, if you connect to Facebook or Google, we may receive information like your name, profile picture, age range, language, email address, and friend list. You may also choose to grant us access to your exercise or activity data from another service. You can stop sharing the information from the other service with us by removing our access to that other service.

 

We may partner with third parties, such as employers and insurance companies that offer Fitbit Services to their employees and customers. In such cases, those companies may provide us with your name, email address, or similar information (like a telephone number or subscriber ID) so that we can invite you to participate or determine your eligibility for particular benefits, such as discounts or free services.

 

HOW WE USE INFORMATION

 

We use the information we collect for the following purposes.

 

PROVIDE AND MAINTAIN THE SERVICES

Using the information we collect, we are able to deliver the Services to you and honor our Terms of Service contract with you. For example, we need to use your information to provide you with your Fitbit dashboard tracking your exercise, activity, and other trends; to enable the community features of the Services; and to give you customer support.


 

For the Services’ community features, we may use your information to help you find and connect with other users and to allow other users to find and connect with you. For example, your account contact information allows other users to add you as a friend. When another user has your email or mobile phone number in their contact list or in their friend network on a connected service, we show that user that you are a user of the Services.

 

If you use the Live Coaching Services, we use your information to connect you with coaches, allow you to communicate with them through our Services, and help you achieve your goals to lead a healthier, more active life. For example, the goals that you provide allow you to develop a personal plan and set of actions in consultation with your coach.

 

IMPROVE, PERSONALIZE, AND DEVELOP THE SERVICES

We use the information we collect to improve and personalize the Services and to develop new ones. For example, we use the information to troubleshoot and protect against errors; perform data analysis and testing; conduct research and surveys; and develop new features and Services.


 

When you allow us to collect precise location information, we use that information to provide and improve features of the Services such as recording where a workout took place or mapping an activity.

 

We also use your information to make inferences and show you more relevant content. Here are some examples:

 

Information like your height, weight, gender, and age allows us to improve the accuracy of your daily exercise and activity statistics like the number of calories you burned and the distance you traveled.

Based on your sleep data, we may make inferences about your sleeping patterns and provide you with customized insights to help you improve your sleep.

We may personalize exercise and activity goals for you based on the goals you previously set and your historical exercise or activity data.

 

COMMUNICATE WITH YOU

We use your information when needed to send you Service notifications and respond to you when you contact us. We also use your information to promote new features or products that we think you would be interested in. You can control marketing communications and most Service notifications by using your notification preferences in account settings or via the “Unsubscribe” link in an email.


 

PROMOTE SAFETY AND SECURITY 

We use the information we collect to promote the safety and security of the Services, our users, and other parties. For example, we may use the information to authenticate users, facilitate secure payments, protect against fraud and abuse, respond to a legal request or claim, conduct audits, and enforce our terms and policies.  


 

We use cookies and similar technologies for the purposes described above. For more information, please read our Cookie Use statement.

 

HOW INFORMATION IS SHARED

 

We never sell the personal information of our users. We do not share your personal information except in the limited circumstances described below.

 

WHEN YOU AGREE OR DIRECT US TO SHARE

You may direct us to disclose your information to others, such as when you use our community features like the forums, 7-day leaderboard, and other social tools. For certain information, we provide you with privacy preferences in account settings and other tools to control how your information is visible to other users of the Services. Just remember that if you choose to participate in a challenge, information like your profile photo, posted messages, total steps in the challenge, personal statistics, and achievements, is not governed by your privacy preferences and will be visible to all other challenge participants.

 

You may also direct us to share your information in other ways, for example, when you give a third-party application access to your account, or give your employer access to information when you choose to participate in an employee wellness program. Remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms. You can revoke your consent to share with third-party applications or employee wellness programs using your account settings.

 

FOR EXTERNAL PROCESSING

We transfer information to our corporate affiliates, service providers, and other partners who process it for us, based on our instructions, and in compliance with this policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. These partners provide us with services globally, including for customer support, information technology, payments, sales, marketing, data analysis, research, and surveys.

 

FOR LEGAL REASONS OR TO PREVENT HARM

We may preserve or disclose information about you to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to assert legal rights or defend against legal claims; or to prevent, detect, or investigate illegal activity, fraud, abuse, violations of our terms, or threats to the security of the Services or the physical safety of any person.

 

Please note: Our policy is to notify you of legal process seeking access to your information, such as search warrants, court orders, or subpoenas, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so. In cases where a court order specifies a non-disclosure period, we provide delayed notice after the expiration of the non-disclosure period. Exceptions to our notice policy include exigent or counterproductive circumstances, for example, when there is an emergency involving a danger of death or serious physical injury to a person.

 

We may share non-personal information that is aggregated or

de-identified so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual. We may disclose such information publicly and to third parties, for example, in public reports about exercise and activity, to partners under agreement with us, or as part of the community benchmarking information we provide to users of our subscription services.

 

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we will continue to take measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information and give affected users notice before transferring any personal information to a new entity.

 

YOUR RIGHTS TO ACCESS AND CONTROL YOUR PERSONAL DATA

 

We give you account settings and tools to access and control your personal data, as described below, regardless of where you live. If you live in certain jurisdictions, you may have legal rights with respect to your information, which your account settings and tools allow you to exercise, as outlined below.

 

Accessing and Exporting Data. By logging into your account, you can access much of your personal information, including your dashboard with your daily exercise and activity statistics. Using your account settings, you can also download information in a commonly used file format, including data about your activities, body, foods, and sleep. Learn more here.

 

Editing and Deleting Data. By logging into your account and using your account settings, you can change and delete your personal information. For instance, you can edit or delete the profile data you provide and delete your account if you wish. Learn more here.

 

If you choose to delete your account, please note that while most of your information will be deleted within 30 days, it may take up to 90 days to delete all of your information, like the data recorded by your Fitbit device and other data stored in our backup systems. This is due to the size and complexity of the systems we use to store data. We may also preserve data for legal reasons or to prevent harm, including as described in the How Information Is Shared section.

 

Objecting to Data Use. We give you account settings and tools to control our data use. For example, through your privacy settings, you can limit how your information is visible to other users of the Services; using your notification settings, you can limit the notifications you receive from us; and under your application settings, you can revoke the access of third-party applications that you previously connected to your Fitbit account. You can also use the Fitbit application to unpair your device from your account at any time.

 

DATA RETENTION

 

We keep your account information, like your name, email address, and password, for as long as your account is in existence because we need it to operate your account. In some cases, when you give us information for a feature of the Services, we delete the data after it is no longer needed for the feature. For instance, when you provide your contact list for finding friends on the Services, we delete the list after it is used for adding contacts as friends. We keep other information, like your exercise or activity data, until you use your account settings or tools to delete the data or your account because we use this data to provide you with your personal statistics and other aspects of the Services. We also keep information about you and your use of the Services for as long as necessary for our legitimate business interests, for legal reasons, and to prevent harm, including as described in the How We Use Information and How Information Is Shared sections.

 

ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHERS


 

We work with partners who provide us with analytics and advertising services. This includes helping us understand how users interact with the Services, serving advertisements on our behalf across the internet, and measuring the performance of those advertisements. These companies may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about your interactions with the Services and other websites and applications. To learn more and about your privacy choices, please read our Cookie Use statement.

 

OUR POLICIES FOR CHILDREN

 

We appreciate the importance of taking additional measures to protect children’s privacy.

 

Fitbit allows parents to set up accounts for their children to use with select Fitbit devices (“Children’s Account”). Children’s Accounts are subject to a separate Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts which explains what information we collect to set up these accounts, what information we collect from a child’s use of our Services, and how we use and share that information. Parents or guardians must consent to the use of their child’s data in accordance with the Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts in order to create such an account.

 

Persons under the age of 13, or any higher minimum age in the jurisdiction where that person resides, are not permitted to create accounts unless their parent has consented in accordance with applicable law. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under the relevant minimum age without parental consent, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Parents who believe that their child has submitted personal information to us and would like to have it deleted may contact us at privacy@fitbit.com.

 

INFORMATION SECURITY


 

We work hard to keep your data safe. We use a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls to maintain the security of your data. This includes using Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) to encrypt many of our Services. No method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure, however. If you have a security-related concern, please contact Customer Support.

 

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND DATA TRANSFERS

 

We operate internationally and transfer information to the United States and other countries for the purposes described in this policy.

 

We rely on multiple legal bases to lawfully transfer personal data around the world. These include your consent and EU Commission approved model contractual clauses, which require certain privacy and security protections. You may obtain copies of the model contractual clauses by contacting us.

 

Please note that the countries where we operate may have privacy and data protection laws that differ from, and are potentially less protective than, the laws of your country. You agree to this risk when you create a Fitbit account and click “I agree” to data transfers, irrespective of which country you live in. For a list of the locations where we have offices, please see our company information here. If you later wish to withdraw your consent, you can delete your Fitbit account as described in the Your Rights To Access and Control Your Personal Data section.

 

While not relied upon for international data transfers, Fitbit LLC complies with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield principles regarding the collection, use, sharing and retention of personal information as described in our Privacy Shield certifications. Learn more about Privacy Shield here. Fitbit LLC is subject to the oversight of the US Federal Trade Commission and remains responsible for personal information that we transfer to others who process it on our behalf as described in the How Information Is Shared section. If you have a complaint about our Privacy Shield compliance, please contact us. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection authority, and in certain circumstances, invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means as described in Annex I to the Privacy Shield Principles.

 

 

EUROPEAN PRIVACY DISCLOSURES

 

If you live in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, please review these additional privacy disclosures under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).

 

YOUR DATA CONTROLLER

Fitbit International Limited, an Irish company, is your data controller and provides the Services if you live in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland. For our contact information, please see the Who We Are and How To Contact Us section.

 

HEALTH AND OTHER SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA

To the extent that information we collect is health data or another special category of personal data subject to the GDPR, we ask for your explicit consent to process the data. We obtain this consent separately when you take actions leading to our obtaining the data, for example, when you pair your device to your account, grant us access to your exercise or activity data from another service, or use the female health tracking feature. You can use your account settings and tools to withdraw your consent at any time, including by stopping use of a feature, removing our access to a third-party service, unpairing your device, or deleting your data or your account.

 

OUR LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA

For personal data subject to the GDPR, we rely on several legal bases to process the data, including:

 

When you have given your consent, which you may withdraw at any time using your account settings and other tools; 

When the processing is necessary to perform a contract with you, like the Terms of Service; and
Our legitimate business interests, such as in improving, personalizing, and developing the Services, marketing new features or products that may be of interest, and promoting safety and security as described in the How We Use Information section.

 

HOW TO EXERCISE YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS

Please review the Your Rights To Access and Control Your Personal Data section for how your account settings and tools allow you to exercise your rights under the GDPR to access and control your personal data.

 

In addition to the various controls that we offer, in certain circumstances, you can seek to restrict our processing of your data, or object to our processing of your data based on our legitimate interests, including as described in the How We Use Information section. Under the GDPR, you have a general right to object to the use of your information for direct marketing purposes. Please see your notification settings to control our marketing communications to you about Fitbit products. Our Cookie Use statement describes your options for controlling how we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies for advertising. Please note that you can always delete your account at any time.


If you need further assistance regarding your rights, please contact our Data Protection Officer at data-protection-office@fitbit.com, and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws. You also have a right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority or with the Irish Data Protection Commission, our lead supervisory authority, whose contact information is available here.

You may exercise these rights using your account settings and tools as described in the Your Rights To Access and Control Your Personal Data section, for example:

 

By logging into your account and using your account settings, you may exercise your right to access your personal information and to understand how we collect, use, and disclose it. Learn more here.

Your account settings also let you exercise your right to delete personal information. Learn more here.


If you need further assistance regarding your rights, please contact our Data Protection Officer at data-protection-office@fitbit.com, and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.

As described in the Information We Collect section, we collect the categories of personal information listed below. We receive this information from you, your device, your use of the Services, your coach if you use our Live Coaching Services, third parties (like the other services you have connected to your Fitbit account, or your employer or insurance company if they offer you Fitbit Services as an employee or customer), and as otherwise described in this policy.

com.fun.share;"YoYo Privacy Policy

Date of Last Revision: July 28,2021

YoYo("" ""we,"" ""us,"" or ""our"") takes the private nature of your information very seriously. This policy regarding our privacy practices (the ""Privacy Policy"") describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use our website FunShare.co and the YoYo Mobile Applications (collectively the ""Site"") and/or YoYo's other domains, products, advertising products, services, and/or content, including our mobile applications (collectively with the Site, the ""Services""). When you use the Services, you also consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy; please read it carefully.

 

What This Privacy Policy Covers

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any information about you that our partners share with us or that we share with our partners. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own, control, or manage, including but not limited to any third party websites, services, applications, or businesses (collectively “Third Party Services”). While we try to work only with those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we don't take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of all Third Party Services you access.

 

What We Collect and How We Use It
Account Information:

Certain visitors to YoYo’s services choose to interact with YoYo in ways that require YoYo to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that YoYo gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Some of our services require you to set up a basic YoYo account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as: a username, a password, an email address, a phone number, full name, display name, moniker (pseudonym), profile pictures, etc. We may use your phone number to verify your Account and if you provide YoYo with your phone number, you agree to receive missed calls / text messages to that number from YoYo. Additionally, our customer service may contact and communicate with you, if necessary. We may use your email address to verify your Account and to communicate with you, as described in more detail below.

We may use Account Information, alone or together with other information, to enhance and improve the Services, such as by personalization.

You can keep yourself fairly anonymous on YoYo, but remember that your posts, comments, shares, username, etc are all visible to the public by default.

Email Communications with Us:

As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us. Administrative communications relating to your Account (e.g., for purposes of Account recovery or password reset) are considered part of the Services and your Account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving. We also may send you other kinds of emails, which you can opt-out of by using the “Opt-Out” link or via an alternate method as mentioned in the emails themselves.

Note that we will never email you to ask for your password or other Account Information; if you receive such an email, please forward it to us.

We send two kinds of email: ones about fun stuff happening on YoYo, and ones with important information about your account. You can opt out of the former, but not the latter.

Information about Your Account on Third Party Services:

You can link your Account to certain Third Party Services. In order to do so, you may provide us with your username or other user ID for a Third Party Services, and you may then be required to log into that Service. After you complete this login process, we will receive a token that allows us to access your account on that Third Party Services so that we can, for example, post your content to that Third Party Services when you ask us to. We do not receive or store your passwords for your Third Party Services accounts. Additionally, you may link your Facebook, Twitter, etc account to YoYo, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (such as your friends or contacts). The information we get from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.

Information Obtained from Third Party Services:

In some cases, we partner with Third Party Services that may provide information about you. Such information could include, for example, your gender, if you have disclosed that information to that Third Party Services and made it available for YoYo to access. To the extent we obtain such information, we may use it to develop new Services or to improve or enhance the Services.

When you connect other Third Party Services to your YoYo account, those Third Party Services might share information about you with us. What gets shown to us is determined by their privacy policies.

User Content:

By default, all sharing through the Services is public, and when you provide us with content it is published so that anyone can view it. Content published and shared publicly is accessible to everyone, including search engines. In addition, information shared publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet, including through actions or features native to the Services, such as Sharing, Resharing, forwarding, etc.

At its core, YoYo is a public platform. Don’t be afraid to share amazing things, but do understand that it can be hard to completely remove things from the internet once they’ve been shared or reshared a few times.

Native Actions:

The Services allow you to perform native actions that are integral to our products, such as liking a post, commenting in a post, sharing a post, replying to a post, etc. Liking, sharing, and replying are public actions – anyone can expand the “activities” view on a post, for example, to see who liked, shared, or replied to a post. We use information about native actions to improve the Services, develop new Services, and, particularly, to personalize your YoYo experience. Personalization using this information may include presenting you with new posts relevant to what you’ve liked, providing you with better search results, and showing you advertising more relevant to your interests

When you share information or content like text, photos, videos, gifs, etc as well as shares, likes, replies, comments, etc via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.

Information About User Content:

In some cases, we may collect information about content you provide to the Services. For example, if the recipient has viewed the content, replayed the content, and the metadata that is provided with the content. When it's included as part of your images, we may collect information describing your camera, camera settings, or EXIF information. This information allows us to improve the Services and provide additional features and functionality.

Camera and Photos

Many of our services require us to collect images and other information from your device’s camera and photos. We’ll access your camera and photos only after you give us your consent.

Information Related to Use of the Services:

These days, whenever you use a website, mobile application or other Internet service, certain information is almost always created and recorded automatically. The same is true when you use our products. We collect information about how people use the Services, including those with an Account. This type of information may be collected in our log files each time you interact with (i.e., make a request to) the Services. We use internal tools and third party applications and services (like Google Analytics, etc) to collect and analyze this information. Some of this information may also be associated with the Internet Protocol Address (“IP Address”) used to access the Services; some may be connected with your Account; and some may only be collected and used in aggregate form (as a statistical measure that wouldn’t identify you or your Account). We also collect your IP Address when you make a post or perform actions like commenting, sharing, etc. We may use this information about how you and others interact with the Services for a number of things generally related to enhancing, improving, protecting, and developing new Services, including but not limited to: providing users with personalized content; providing users with targeted advertising; improving our search results; identifying trending or popular content; fighting spam, malware, identity theft and generally keeping our users and community safe; and for legal and safety reasons as set forth in “Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.”

We use information about how you interact with YoYo in order to personalize it for you, to keep both you and our community safe from harm, and to improve YoYo for everyone who uses it.

Information Related to Your Web Browser:

We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, such as your browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your operating system and version, your language preference, the website or service that referred you to the Services, the date and time of each request you make to the Services, your screen display information, and information from any cookies we have placed on your web browser (as described below). We also sometimes detect whether you are using certain web browser extensions and store that information in a manner associated with your Account. We use web browser-related information to enhance and improve the Services.

Information Related to Your Mobile Device:

We may collect and store information related to your mobile device. We may also ask you to provide your phone number to enable new products and improve the Services, such as by enabling multi-factor authentication for Account login.

Information Collected Using Cookies:

A cookie, also known as a web cookie, browser cookie, and HTTP cookie, is a piece of text stored by a user's web browser. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us if you fill in a contact form or email us. You can choose to accept or decline cookies, and delete existing ones. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. The help section of your chosen browser or it’s accompanying website will provide instructions on how to accept, decline and delete cookies.

Declining cookies may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website, however, as some functionality like login, etc may not work.

Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others

Some services that we use (including Third Party Services such as Advertising partners, Analytics partners, etc), such as Google Analytics, etc may also place their own cookies (or by similar technologies) on your browser. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Note that, unless otherwise disclosed, this Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.

Information About Your Contacts:

Certain features of the Services allow you to provide us with your contact lists, so that we can connect you with people in our Services that are also on those contact lists. We may, with your consent collect information from your device’s phonebook. As an example, you can send us your mobile phone contact information through our mobile applications, which then allows us to provide you with a list of those contacts that use the Services so that you can “follow” them. As another example, when you let us access your device phonebook, we may share information about you with other users who have your phone number in their device phonebook

 

How we Share Information

We may share information about you in the following ways:

Information Shared with the Public Through the Services:

As noted in “User Content” and “Native Actions,” above, by default, content published through the Services and many actions you take on the Services are shared with the public. Because this kind of information can be seen by anyone and may be indexed by search engines, you should be careful about what you choose to disclose publicly and make sure it’s information you want to share with everyone.

The content you create on YoYo is, by default, public. This means that anyone can see it, and that search engines can index it.

User Consent or Direction:

We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account.

Information You Share with Third Party Services:

The services may also contain third-party links and search results, include third-party integrations, or be a co-branded or third-party-branded service that’s being provided jointly with or by another company. By going to those links, using the third-party integration, or using a co-branded or third-party-branded service, you may be providing information (including personal information) directly to the third party, us, or both. You may also choose to share information that you provide to us, like posts, with those Third Party Services (for example, by sharing posts to Twitter or Facebook). That’s where our Privacy Policy ends and their policies begin. Make sure you are comfortable with the policies of any services you’re considering sharing to before connecting them to your YoYo account. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party website or service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our services. This Privacy Policy only governs information we collect and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third Party Services' privacy policies.

Information Shared with Our Agents in Order to Operate and Improve the Services:

In some cases, we share information that we store (such as IP Addresses) with third parties, such as service providers, consultants, and other agents (collectively ""Agents""), for the purposes of operating, enhancing, and improving the Services, and developing new products and services. For example, we may share information with service providers in order to fight spam, and third-party consultants may have access to information in the process of improving our processes and technology. Agents with whom we share such information for these reasons are generally bound by confidentiality obligations and, unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use information we share with them beyond the scope and duration of what is necessary to assist us.

Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell business assets. In these transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others:

We believe in freedom of expression, and, to the extent reasonable, we try to protect our community from baseless legal demands. That said, we also reserve the right to access, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary, in our sole discretion, to (i) satisfy any law, regulation, legal process, governmental request, or governmental order, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our terms and conditions, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, trust and safety, or technical issues (including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of improving security and preventing fraud, spam, and malware), (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property, health or safety of us, our users, any third parties or the public in general.

Information We Share with Your Consent or at Your Request:

If you ask us to release information that we have about your Account, we will do so if reasonable and not unduly burdensome.

To Service Providers Performing Services on Our Behalf:

We may contract with third party companies to perform services on our behalf, including but not limited to marketing assistance, e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer service, and data analysis. We require any third party service providers to maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed to them and are not permitted to use your Personal Information for any purpose other than to provide services to YoYo.

Information Shared with Other Third Parties:

We may share or disclose non-private information, Aggregate Information, or other non-personally identifying information with people and entities that we do business with.

 

The Security of Your Information

Your Account Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. We may enable additional security features in the future, like multi-factor authentication. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your Account and information by creating a unique, secure, and protected password and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your Account on the Services.

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.

We seek to protect your information (including your Account Information) to ensure that it is kept private; However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We can't guarantee the security of any information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.

 

What Information You Can Access

If you are a registered user, you can access most information associated with your Account by logging into the Services and checking your Account Settings page. Registered and unregistered users can access and delete cookies through their web browser settings.

 

Our policy towards children

This Website is not intended for children under the age of 12 and we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from such children. Children under the age of 12 should not use our Website or our Services at any time. In the event that we learn that we have inadvertently gathered Personal Information from children under the age of 12, we will use reasonable efforts to erase such information from our records.

 

How to Delete Your Account and Data

If you want to delete your Account and Data, you can do so by emailing us at support@funshareapp.com and providing proof of authority over the Account. What constitutes ""proof of authority"" will vary depending on the circumstances, but generally will require sufficient identifying information so that we can be confident you are the Account owner.

We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for the legal basis relied upon and as permitted by applicable law.

You may permanently delete your Account and Data at any time.

When your Account is deactivated, we take reasonable efforts to make sure it is no longer viewable on the App. For up to 28 days, it is still possible to restore your Account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. After 28 days, we begin the process of deleting your personal information from our systems, unless:

we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, if you make purchases within the App, some personal data may need to be kept for accounting purposes);
we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law;
there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or
the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing Users’ safety and security. For example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behaviour or security incidents from opening a new account.

Where YoYo uses machine learning, for example, to help us detect and prevent fraudulent card transactions, and to detect and prevent spam communications on the App (as explained above), we may need to keep personal information for a longer period than the retention periods explained above, to enable the machine learning to work properly. Where this is the case, we always seek to minimise the amount of personal information that is used and we ensure that it is ring-fenced and kept securely from other User personal information. We regularly review the period for which personal information is required for machine learning purposes and delete any identifiable information when it is no longer required.

To prevent abuse and/or misuse of YoYo by a User following termination or deletion of a profile/Account we shall retain such information as we deem in our sole discretion may be necessary to ensure that User does not open a new Account and profile in breach of our Terms and Conditions of Use and to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations.

Warning: Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your Account, copies of that information may still be viewable and/or accessed to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by others. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this.

About this policy
Related privacy practices

We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:

Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps

You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.

To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.

INFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS

We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services

We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.

When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.

When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.

Things you create or provide to us

When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services.

We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.

Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices

We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.

The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.

We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device.

Your activity

We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:

Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account

If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.

You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.

Go to Google Account

Your location information

We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your general location.

Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:

GPS and other sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services, such as your searches and places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices

The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.

In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from advertising partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.

We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.

WHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA

We use data to build better services

We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:

Provide our services

We use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.

Maintain & improve our services

We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.

Develop new services

We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.

Provide personalized services, including content and ads

We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.

Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.

We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.

Go to Ad Settings

Measure performance

We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.

Communicate with you

We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.

Protect Google, our users, and the public

We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.

We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.

We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.

If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.

We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

YOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS

You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used

This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.

Go to Privacy Checkup

Managing, reviewing, and updating your information

When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.

We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:

Privacy controls
Activity Controls

Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.

Go to Activity Controls

Ad settings

Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.

Go to Ad Settings

About you

Manage personal info in your Google Account and control who can see it across Google services.

Go to About You

YouTube settings: Pause and delete your YouTube Search History and your YouTube Watch History.
Ad Settings: Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Exporting, removing & deleting your information

You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

Export your data

You can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law.

To delete your information, you can:

Delete your content from specific Google services
Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity
Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products
Delete your entire Google Account

Delete your information

And finally, Inactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.

There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:

Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.
SHARING YOUR INFORMATION
When you share your information

Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.

When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.

When Google shares your information

We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:

With your consent

We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.

With domain administrators

If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:

Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing

We provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.

For legal reasons

We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:

Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.

We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.

If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE

We build security into our services to protect your information

All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.

We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:

We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing, Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
EXPORTING & DELETING YOUR INFORMATION

You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time

You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

Export your data

To delete your information, you can:

Delete your content from specific Google services
Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity
Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products
Delete your entire Google Account

Delete your information

RETAINING YOUR INFORMATION

We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:

Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as the content you create or upload. You can also delete activity information saved in your account, or choose to have it deleted automatically after a set period of time.
Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as advertising data in server logs.
We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.

When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.

You can read more about Google’s data retention periods, including how long it takes us to delete your information.

COMPLIANCE & COOPERATION WITH REGULATORS

We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.

Data transfers

We maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.

When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.

European requirements

If European Union (EU) or United Kingdom (UK) data protection law applies to the processing of your information, we provide the controls described in this policy so you can exercise your right to request access to, update, remove, and restrict the processing of your information. You also have the right to object to the processing of your information or export your information to another service.

Unless otherwise stated in a service-specific privacy notice, the data controller responsible for processing your information depends on where you are based:

Google Ireland Limited for users of Google services based in the European Economic Area or Switzerland
Google LLC for users of Google services based in the United Kingdom

Google LLC is the data controller responsible for processing information indexed and displayed in services like Google Search and Google Maps regardless of your location.

We process your information for the purposes described in this policy, based on the following legal grounds:

With your consent

We ask for your agreement to process your information for specific purposes and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. For example, we ask for your consent to provide you with personalized services, such as ads based on your interests. We also ask for your consent to collect your voice and audio activity for speech recognition. You can manage these settings in your Google Account.

When we’re pursuing legitimate interests

We process your information for our legitimate interests and those of third parties while applying appropriate safeguards that protect your privacy. This means that we process your information for things like:

Providing, maintaining, and improving our services to meet the needs of our users
Developing new products and features that are useful for our users
Understanding how people use our services to ensure and improve the performance of our services
Customizing our services to provide you with a better user experience (and, if relevant, tailoring the experience to be age-appropriate)
Marketing to inform users about our services
Providing advertising, which allows us to offer many of our services without a fee (and when ads are personalized, we ask for your consent)
Detecting, preventing, or otherwise addressing fraud, abuse, security, or technical issues with our services
Protecting against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law, including disclosing information to government authorities
Performing research that improves our services for our users and benefits the public
Fulfilling obligations to our partners like developers and rights holders
Enforcing legal claims, including investigation of potential violations of applicable Terms of Service
When we’re providing a service

We process your data to provide a service you’ve asked for under a contract. For example, we process your payment information when you buy extra storage for Google Drive.

When we’re complying with legal obligations

We’ll process your data when we have a legal obligation to do so, for example, if we’re responding to legal process or an enforceable governmental request.

If you have questions, you can contact Google and our data protection office. And you can contact your local data protection authority if you have concerns regarding your rights under local law.

INFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS

We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services

We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.

When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.

When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.

Things you create or provide to us

When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services.

We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.

Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices

We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.

The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.

We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device.

Your activity

We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:

Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information

People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account

If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.

You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.

Go to Google Account

Your location information

We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your general location.

Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:

GPS and other sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services, such as your searches and places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices

The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.

In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from advertising partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.

We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.

WHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA

We use data to build better services

We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:

Provide our services

We use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.

Maintain & improve our services

We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.

Develop new services

We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.

Provide personalized services, including content and ads

We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.

Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.

We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.

Go to Ad Settings

Measure performance

We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.

Communicate with you

We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.

Protect Google, our users, and the public

We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.

We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.

We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.

If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.

We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

YOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS

You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used

This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.

Go to Privacy Checkup

Managing, reviewing, and updating your information

When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.

We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:

Privacy controls
Activity Controls

Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.

Go to Activity Controls

Ad settings

Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.

And finally, Inactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.

There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:

Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.
SHARING YOUR INFORMATION
When you share your information

Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.

When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.

When Google shares your information

We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:

With your consent

We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.

With domain administrators

If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:

Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing

We provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.

For legal reasons

We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:

Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.

We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.

If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE

We build security into our services to protect your information

All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.

We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:

We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing, Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
EXPORTING & DELETING YOUR INFORMATION

You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time

You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

Export your data

To delete your information, you can:

Delete your content from specific Google services
Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity
Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products
Delete your entire Google Account

Delete your information

RETAINING YOUR INFORMATION

We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:

Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as the content you create or upload. You can also delete activity information saved in your account, or choose to have it deleted automatically after a set period of time.
Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as advertising data in server logs.
We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.

When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.

You can read more about Google’s data retention periods, including how long it takes us to delete your information.

COMPLIANCE & COOPERATION WITH REGULATORS

We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.

Data transfers

We maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.

When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.

European requirements

If European Union (EU) or United Kingdom (UK) data protection law applies to the processing of your information, we provide the controls described in this policy so you can exercise your right to request access to, update, remove, and restrict the processing of your information. You also have the right to object to the processing of your information or export your information to another service.

Unless otherwise stated in a service-specific privacy notice, the data controller responsible for processing your information depends on where you are based:

Google Ireland Limited for users of Google services based in the European Economic Area or Switzerland
Google LLC for users of Google services based in the United Kingdom

Google LLC is the data controller responsible for processing information indexed and displayed in services like Google Search and Google Maps regardless of your location.

We process your information for the purposes described in this policy, based on the following legal grounds:

With your consent

We ask for your agreement to process your information for specific purposes and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. For example, we ask for your consent to provide you with personalized services, such as ads based on your interests. We also ask for your consent to collect your voice and audio activity for speech recognition. You can manage these settings in your Google Account.

When we’re pursuing legitimate interests

We process your information for our legitimate interests and those of third parties while applying appropriate safeguards that protect your privacy. This means that we process your information for things like:

Providing, maintaining, and improving our services to meet the needs of our users
Developing new products and features that are useful for our users
Understanding how people use our services to ensure and improve the performance of our services
Customizing our services to provide you with a better user experience (and, if relevant, tailoring the experience to be age-appropriate)

Detecting, preventing, or otherwise addressing fraud, abuse, security, or technical issues with our services
Protecting against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law, including disclosing information to government authorities
Performing research that improves our services for our users and benefits the public
Fulfilling obligations to our partners like developers and rights holders
Enforcing legal claims, including investigation of potential violations of applicable Terms of Service
When we’re providing a service

We process your data to provide a service you’ve asked for under a contract. For example, we process your payment information when you buy extra storage for Google Drive.

When we’re complying with legal obligations

We’ll process your data when we have a legal obligation to do so, for example, if we’re responding to legal process or an enforceable governmental request.

If you have questions, you can contact Google and our data protection office. And you can contact your local data protection authority if you have concerns regarding your rights under local law.

Effective August 11, 2020

Our Privacy Policy has been updated.

Your Privacy Matters

LinkedIn’s mission is to connect the world’s professionals to allow them to be more productive and successful. Central to this mission is our commitment to be transparent about the data we collect about you, how it is used and with whom it is shared.

This Privacy Policy applies when you use our Services (described below). We offer our users choices about the data we collect, use and share as described in this Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Settings and our Help Center.

Introduction

We are a social network and online platform for professionals. People use our Services to find and be found for business opportunities, to connect with others and find information. Our Privacy Policy applies to any Member or Visitor to our Services.

Our registered users (“Members”) share their professional identities, engage with their network, exchange knowledge and professional insights, post and view relevant content, learn and develop skills, and find business and career opportunities. Content and data on some of our Services is viewable to non-members (“Visitors”).

We use the term “Designated Countries” to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland.

Services

This Privacy Policy, including our Cookie Policy applies to your use of our Services.

This Privacy Policy applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, LinkedIn Learning and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps, communications and services (“Services”), including off-site Services, such as our ad services and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins, but excluding services that state that they are offered under a different privacy policy. For California residents, additional disclosures required by California law may be found in our California Privacy Disclosure.

Data Controllers and Contracting Parties

If you are in the “Designated Countries”, LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company (“LinkedIn Ireland”) will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.

If you are outside of the Designated Countries, LinkedIn Corporation will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with, our Services.

As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use and sharing of your personal data is subject to this Privacy Policy and other documents referenced in this Privacy Policy, as well as updates.

Change

Changes to the Privacy Policy apply to your use of our Services after the “effective date.”

LinkedIn (“we” or “us”) can modify this Privacy Policy, and if we make material changes to it, we will provide notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. If you object to any changes, you may close your account.

You acknowledge that your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to this Privacy Policy means that the collection, use and sharing of your personal data is subject to the updated Privacy Policy, as of its effective date.

1. Data We Collect
1.1 Data You Provide To Us

You provide data to create an account with us.

Registration

To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email address and/or mobile number, and a password. If you register for a premium Service, you will need to provide payment (e.g., credit card) and billing information.

You create your LinkedIn profile (a complete profile helps you get the most from our Services).

Profile

You have choices about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo, city or area and endorsements. Some Members may choose to complete a separate ProFinder profile. You don’t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find you. It’s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available.

You give other data to us, such as by syncing your address book or calendar.

Posting and Uploading

We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, (e.g., with demographic data or salary), respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job application on our Services. If you opt to import your address book, we receive your contacts (including contact information your service provider(s) or app automatically added to your address book when you communicated with addresses or numbers not already in your list).

If you sync your contacts or calendars with our Services, we will collect your address book and calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others, and by providing information about events, e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts.

You don’t have to post or upload personal data; though if you don’t, it may limit your ability to grow and engage with your network over our Services.

1.2 Data From Others

Others may post or write about you.

Content and News

You and others may post content that includes information about you (as part of articles, posts, comments, videos) on our Services. We also may collect public information about you, such as professional-related news and accomplishments, and make it available as part of our Services, including, as permitted by your settings, in notifications to others of mentions in the news.

Others may sync their contacts or calendar with our Services

Contact and Calendar Information

We receive personal data (including contact information) about you when others import or sync their contacts or calendar with our Services, associate their contacts with Member profiles, scan and upload business cards, or send messages using our Services (including invites or connection requests). If you or others opt-in to sync email accounts with our Services, we will also collect “email header” information that we can associate with Member profiles.

Customers and partners may provide data to us.

Partners

We receive personal data (e.g., your job title and work email address) about you when you use the services of our customers and partners, such as employers or prospective employers and applicant tracking systems providing us job application data.

Related Companies and Other Services

We receive data about you when you use some of the other services provided by us or our affiliates, including Microsoft. For example, you may choose to send us information about your contacts in Microsoft apps and services, such as Outlook, for improved professional networking activities on our Services

1.3 Service Use

We log your visits and use of our Services, including mobile apps.

We log usage data when you visit or otherwise use our Services, including our sites, app and platform technology, such as when you view or click on content (e.g., learning video) or ads (on or off our sites and apps), perform a search, install or update one of our mobile apps, share articles or apply for jobs. We use log-ins, cookies, device information and internet protocol (“IP”) addresses to identify you and log your use.

1.4 Cookies and Similar Technologies

We collect data through cookies and similar technologies.

As further described in our Cookie Policy, we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and ad tags) to collect data (e.g., device IDs) to recognize you and your device(s) on, off and across different services and devices where you have engaged with our Services. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy. If you are outside the Designated Countries, we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness. Learn more. You can opt out from our use of data from cookies and similar technologies that track your behavior on the sites of others for ad targeting and other ad-related purposes. For Visitors, the controls are here.

1.5 Your Device and Location

We receive data through cookies and similar technologies

When you visit or leave our Services (including some plugins and our cookies or similar technology on the sites of others), we receive the URL of both the site you came from and the one you go to and the time of your visit. We also get information about your network and device (e.g., IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, cookie IDs and/or ISP, or your mobile carrier). If you use our Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location.

1.6 Messages

If you communicate through our Services, we learn about that.

We collect information about you when you send, receive, or engage with messages in connection with our Services. For example, if you get a LinkedIn connection request, we track whether you have acted on it and will send you reminders. We also use automatic scanning technology on messages to support and protect our site. For example, we use this technology to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or block content that violates our User Agreement or Professional Community Policies from our Services.

1.7 Workplace and School Provided Information

When your organization (e.g., employer or school) buys a premium Service for you to use, they give us data about you.

Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For example, we will get contact information for “Company Page” administrators and for authorizing users of our premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products.

1.8 Sites and Services of Others

We get data when you visit sites that include our ads, cookies or some of our plugins or when you log-in to others’ services with your LinkedIn account.

We receive information about your visits and interaction with services provided by others when you log-in with LinkedIn or visit others’ services that include some of our plugins (such as “Apply with LinkedIn”) or our ads, cookies or similar technologies.

1.9 Other

We are improving our Services, which means we get new data and create new ways to use data.

Our Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we collect, use or share your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.

Key Terms 
2. How We Use Your Data

We use your data to provide, support, personalize and develop our Services.

How we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your settings. We use the data that we have about you to provide and personalize our Services, including with the help of automated systems and inferences we make, so that our Services (including ads) can be more relevant and useful to you and others.

2.1 Services

Our Services help you connect with others, find and be found for work and business opportunities, stay informed, get training and be more productive.

We use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings.

Stay Connected

Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to “connect” with you. Subject to your and their settings, when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities.

We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event).

It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can choose whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections.

Visitors have choices about how we use their data.

Stay Informed

Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your settings, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a social action, used a feature, made new connections or were mentioned in the news.

Career

Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a specific task) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs or mentees, show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are interested in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services.

Productivity

Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your settings allow, we scan messages to provide “bots” or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps. Learn more.

2.2 Premium Services

Our premium Services help paying users to search for and contact Members through our Services, such as searching for and contacting job candidates, sales leads and co-workers, manage talent and promote content through social media.

We sell premium Services that provide our customers and subscribers with customized-search functionality and tools (including messaging and activity alerts) as part of our talent, marketing and sales solutions. Customers can export limited information from your profile, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location (e.g., Dublin), such as to manage sales leads or talent, unless you opt-out. We do not provide contact information to customers as part of these premium Services without your consent. Premium Services customers can store information they have about you in our premium Services, such as a resume or contact information or sales history. The data stored about you by these customers is subject to the policies of those customers. Other enterprise Services and features that use your data include TeamLink and Elevate (social promotion of content).

2.3 Communications

We contact you and enable communications between Members. We offer settings to control what messages you receive and how often you receive some types of messages.

We will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also send messages about how to use our Services, network updates, reminders, job suggestions and promotional messages from us and our partners. You may change your communication preferences at any time. Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from us, including security and legal notices.

We also enable communications between you and others through our Services, including for example invitations, InMail, groups and messages between connections.

2.4 Advertising

We serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services. We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing other ads.

We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined:

Data from advertising technologies on and off our Services, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and device identifiers;
Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and industry);
Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, connections, groups participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3;
Information from advertising partners, vendors and publishers; and
Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using device data to recognize you as a Member).

We will show you ads called sponsored content which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your settings, if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown.

Ad Choices

We adhere to self-regulatory principles for interest-based advertising and participate in industry opt-outs from such ads. This does not opt you out of receiving advertising; you will continue to get other ads by advertisers not listed with these self regulatory tools. You can also opt-out specifically from our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. For Visitors, the setting is here.

Info to Ad Providers

We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. In such instances, we seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so.

2.5 Marketing

We promote our Services to you and others.

In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services.

2.6 Developing Services and Research

We develop our Services and conduct research

Service Development

We use data, including public feedback, to conduct research and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.

Other Research

We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these jobs and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under controls that are designed to protect your privacy. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data.

Surveys

Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may opt-out of survey invitations.

2.7 Customer Support

We use data to help you and fix problems.

We use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs).

2.8 Insights That Do Not Identify You

We use data to generate insights that do not identify you.

We use your data to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on, or to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights.

2.9 Security and Investigations

We use data for security, fraud prevention and investigations.

We use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of our User Agreement and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors or others.

Key Terms 
3. How We Share Information
3.1 Our Services

Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings.

Profile

Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third- party search engines). As detailed in our Help Center, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.

Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages

Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.

When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).
In a group, posts are visible to others in the group. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings.
Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by it and others who visit those pages.
When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower.
We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable.
Subject to your settings, we let a Member know when you view their profile.
When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).

Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.

Enterprise Accounts

Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.

Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).

Subject to your settings, when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.

3.2 Communication Archival

Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.

Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.

3.3 Others’ Services

You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.

Subject to your settings, other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts.

Subject to your settings, excerpts from your profile will appear on the services of others (e.g., search engine results, mail and calendar applications that show a user limited profile data of the person they are meeting or messaging, social media aggregators, talent and lead managers). “Old” profile information remains on these services until they update their data cache with changes you made to your profile.

3.4 Related Services

We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.

We will share your personal data with our affiliates to provide and develop our Services. We may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history.

3.5 Service Providers

We may use others to help us with our Services.

We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development). They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.

3.6 Legal Disclosures

We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.

It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report.

3.7 Change in Control or Sale

We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.

4. Your Choices & Obligations
4.1 Data Retention

We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open.

We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form.

4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data

You can access or delete your personal data. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared.

We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication controls. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you.

For personal data that we have about you, you can:

Delete Data: You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you).
Change or Correct Data: You can edit some of your personal data through your account. You can also ask us to change, update or fix your data in certain cases, particularly if it’s inaccurate.
Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data: You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held).

4.3 Account Closure

We keep some of your data even after you close your account.

If you choose to close your LinkedIn account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on our Services within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below.

We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have restricted your account for breach of our Professional Community Policies), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to ""unsubscribe"" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.

Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search engine results) until they refresh their cache.

EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield

Microsoft adheres to the principles of the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, although Microsoft does not rely on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as a legal basis for transfers of personal data in light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in Case C-311/18.

If you have a privacy concern, complaint, or question for the Microsoft Chief Privacy Officer or EU Data Protection Officer, please contact us by using our web form. For more information about contacting Microsoft, including Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, see the How to contact us section of this privacy statement.

Personal data we collect

Microsoft collects data from you, through our interactions with you and through our products. You provide some of this data directly, and we get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use, and experiences with our products. The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Microsoft and the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the products and features you use. We also obtain data about you from third parties.

If you represent an organization, such as a business or school, that utilizes Enterprise and Developer Products from Microsoft, please see the Enterprise and developer products section of this privacy statement to learn how we process your data. If you are an end user of a Microsoft product or a Microsoft account provided by your organization, please see the Products provided by your organization and the Microsoft account sections for more information.

You have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you share. When we ask you to provide personal data, you can decline. Many of our products require some personal data to provide you with a service. If you choose not to provide data required to provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature. Likewise, where we need to collect personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter into the contract; or if this relates to an existing product you’re using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. We will notify you if this is the case at the time. Where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalization that use such data will not work for you.

How we use personal data

Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you with rich, interactive experiences. In particular, we use data to:

Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support. It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.
Improve and develop our products.
Personalize our products and make recommendations.
Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers.

We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.

In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.

Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing. Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods. For example, our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI), which we think of as a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and assist in decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what people do. To build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made. For example, we manually review short snippets of voice data that we have taken steps to de-identify to improve our speech recognition technologies. This manual review may be conducted by Microsoft employees or vendors who are working on Microsoft’s behalf.

Reasons we share personal data

We also share data with Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries; with vendors working on our behalf; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of our products; and to protect the rights and property of Microsoft and its customers.

How to access and control your personal data

You can also make choices about the collection and use of your data by Microsoft. You can control your personal data that Microsoft has obtained, and exercise your data protection rights, by contacting Microsoft or using various tools we provide. In some cases, your ability to access or control your personal data will be limited, as required or permitted by applicable law. How you can access or control your personal data will also depend on which products you use. For example, you can:

Control the use of your data for interest-based advertising from Microsoft by visiting our opt-out page.
Choose whether you wish to receive promotional emails, SMS messages, telephone calls, and postal mail from Microsoft.
Access and clear some of your data through the Microsoft privacy dashboard.

Not all personal data processed by Microsoft can be accessed or controlled via the tools above. If you want to access or control personal data processed by Microsoft that is not available via the tools above or directly through the Microsoft products you use, you can always contact Microsoft at the address in the How to contact us section or by using our web form.

We provide aggregate metrics about user requests to exercise their data protection rights via the Microsoft Privacy Report.

Cookies and similar technologies

Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the domain that placed the cookie. We use cookies and similar technologies for storing and honoring your preferences and settings, enabling you to sign in, providing interest-based advertising, combating fraud, analyzing how our products perform, and fulfilling other legitimate purposes. Microsoft apps use additional identifiers, such as the advertising ID in Windows described in the Advertising ID section of this privacy statement, for similar purposes.

We also use “web beacons” to help deliver cookies and gather usage and performance data. Our websites may include web beacons, cookies, or similar technologies from third-party service providers.

You have a variety of tools to control the data collected by cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies. For example, you can use controls in your internet browser to limit how the websites you visit are able to use cookies and to withdraw your consent by clearing or blocking cookies.

Products provided by your organization—notice to end users

If you use a Microsoft product with an account provided by an organization you are affiliated with, such as your work or school account, that organization can:

Control and administer your Microsoft product and product account, including controlling privacy-related settings of the product or product account.
Access and process your data, including the interaction data, diagnostic data, and the contents of your communications and files associated with your Microsoft product and product accounts.

If you lose access to your work or school account (in event of change of employment, for example), you may lose access to products and the content associated with those products, including those you acquired on your own behalf, if you used your work or school account to sign in to such products.

Many Microsoft products are intended for use by organizations, such as schools and businesses. Please see the Enterprise and developer products section of this privacy statement. If your organization provides you with access to Microsoft products, your use of the Microsoft products is subject to your organization's policies, if any. You should direct your privacy inquiries, including any requests to exercise your data protection rights, to your organization’s administrator. When you use social features in Microsoft products, other users in your network may see some of your activity. To learn more about the social features and other functionality, please review documentation or help content specific to the Microsoft product. Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of our customers, which may differ from those set forth in this privacy statement.

When you use a Microsoft product provided by your organization, Microsoft’s processing of your personal data in connection with that product is governed by a contract between Microsoft and your organization. Microsoft processes your personal data to provide the product to your organization and you, and in some cases for Microsoft’s business operations related to providing the product as described in the Enterprise and developer products section. As mentioned above, if you have questions about Microsoft’s processing of your personal data in connection with providing products to your organization, please contact your organization. If you have questions about Microsoft’s business operations in connection with providing products to your organization as provided in the Product Terms, please contact Microsoft as described in the How to contact us section. For more information on our business operations, please see the Enterprise and developer products section.

For Microsoft products provided by your K-12 school, including Microsoft 365 Education, Microsoft will:

not collect or use student personal data beyond that needed for authorized educational or school purposes;
not sell or rent student personal data;
not use or share student personal data for advertising or similar commercial purposes, such as behavioral targeting of advertisements to students;
not build a personal profile of a student, other than for supporting authorized educational or school purposes or as authorized by the parent, guardian, or student of appropriate age; and
require that our vendors with whom student personal data is shared to deliver the educational service, if any, are obligated to implement these same commitments for student personal data.

Microsoft account

With a Microsoft account, you can sign in to Microsoft products, as well as those of select Microsoft partners. Personal data associated with your Microsoft account includes credentials, name and contact data, payment data, device and usage data, your contacts, information about your activities, and your interests and favorites. Signing in to your Microsoft account enables personalization and consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account, and enables other features.

There are three types of Microsoft account:

When you create your own Microsoft account tied to your personal email address, we refer to that account as a personal Microsoft account.
When you or your organization (such as an employer or your school) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address provided by that organization, we refer to that account as a work or school account.
When you or your service provider (such as a cable or internet service provider) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address with your service provider’s domain, we refer to that account as a third-party account.

If you sign into a service offered by a third party with your Microsoft account, you will share with that third party the account data required by that service.

Collection of data from children

When a Microsoft product collects age, and there is an age in your jurisdiction under which parental consent or authorization is required to use the product, the product will either block users under that age or will ask them to provide consent or authorization from a parent or guardian before they can use it. We will not knowingly ask children under that age to provide more data than is required to provide for the product.

Once parental consent or authorization is granted, the child's account is treated much like any other account. The child can access communication services, like Outlook and Skype, and can freely communicate and share data with other users of all ages. Learn more about parental consent and Microsoft child accounts.

Parents or guardians can change or revoke the consent choices previously made, and review, edit, or request the deletion of the personal data of the children for whom they provided consent or authorization. As the organizer of a Microsoft family group, the parent or guardian can manage a child’s information and settings on their Family Safety page and view and delete a child’s data on their privacy dashboard.

General. When a customer tries, purchases, uses, or subscribes to Enterprise and Developer Products, or obtains support for or professional services with such products, Microsoft receives data from you and collects and generates data to provide the service (including improving, securing, and updating the service), conduct our business operations, and communicate with the customer. For example:

Windows

Windows is a personalized computing environment that enables you to seamlessly roam and access services, preferences, and content across your computing devices from phones to tablets to the Surface Hub. Rather than residing as a static software program on your device, key components of Windows are cloud-based, and both cloud and local elements of Windows are updated regularly, providing you with the latest improvements and features. In order to provide this computing experience, we collect data about you, your device, and the way you use Windows. And because Windows is personal to you, we give you choices about the personal data we collect and how we use it. Note that if your Windows device is managed by your organization (such as your employer or school), your organization may use centralized management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data and to control device settings (including privacy settings), device policies, software updates, data collection by us or the organization, or other aspects of your device. Additionally, your organization may use management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data from that device, including your interaction data, diagnostic data, and the contents of your communications and files. For more information about data collection in Windows, see Data collection summary for Windows. This statement discusses Windows 10 and Windows 11 and references to Windows in this section relate to those product versions. Earlier versions of Windows (including Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1) are subject to their own privacy statements.

If you object to any terms and conditions of the TOS or any subsequent changes or you become dissatisfied with MeetMe in any way, your only option is to delete your account.

Content

By Content we mean all data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, artwork, video, pictures, images, posts, broadcasts, messages or other materials of any kind, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted. Your Content is your sole responsibility. You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents and permissions to publish all of your Content. Except as set forth in our Privacy Policy, we are not responsible for any Content that you upload or transmit on MeetMe. We do not control the posted Content and, as such, we do not control its accuracy, integrity, quality or any other aspect. Under no circumstances are we liable in any way for any Content, including but not limited to any errors or omissions in any Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content.

You hereby grant us a perpetual, assignable, world-wide, royalty free, sub-licensable and non-exclusive license to use, distribute, reproduce, record, modify, adapt, process, combine, synchronize, create derivative works from, publish, publicly perform and publicly display such Content (including your user name and likeness) on MeetMe and elsewhere in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed) for any promotional and other commercial purpose, whether by us, our partners or other third parties, in our sole discretion.

This license authorizes us to make your Content available to the rest of the world and to let others do the same. You agree that this license includes the right for us to provide, promote, and improve MeetMe and to make Content submitted to or through MeetMe available to other companies, organizations or individuals for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, promotion or publication of such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions for such Content use. Such additional uses by us, or other companies, organizations or individuals, may be made with no compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through MeetMe.

We may use your feedback, comments and suggestions without any obligation to compensate you for them. We may continue to use and make available any and all Content and we will continue to have all of these rights even if your account is terminated.

You acknowledge and agree that we do not promise to screen Content, but that we have the right to do so. We have the right to remove any Content that violates the TOS or that we find objectionable. You accept liability associated with the use of any Content, including but not limited to your reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content.

You may not reproduce, republish, further distribute or publicly exhibit any Content on MeetMe that is not yours.

Subscriptions and Virtual Currency
Subscriptions

You may purchase a subscription product (such as MeetMe+) in various packages, such as one-month, three-month, or six-month subscriptions. For all mobile subscriptions, payment will be charged to your iTunes or Google account when you confirm your purchase. Your subscription will renew automatically for the same amount of time as your original subscription unless you switch off the auto-renew feature at least 24 hours before the end of your current subscription. This is because your account may be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of your current subscription period. You can manage your subscription and switch off auto-renewal by accessing your iTunes or Google account settings. You may not cancel your current subscription during the subscription period, although you may cancel automatic renewal at any time.

Both Apple and Google facilitate “free trials” of subscription products (such as MeetMe+) for first-time users and we take advantage of that ability. For example, from time to time we offer a free initial week to first-time MeetMe+ subscribers. Eligibility for any such trial is limited to users who have not previously subscribed to MeetMe+, through either a current or prior MeetMe account. If you are a previous MeetMe+ subscriber and try to claim a free trial, you should be aware that Apple or Google may recognize your ineligibility. If so, you may not receive a free trial, but instead may be charged immediately for your first subscription month. This is a feature controlled by the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store, depending on which platform you use for MeetMe.

Purchases of Subscriptions are non-refundable and non-transferable, even if they expire or are discontinued. We may change the purchase price for Subscriptions at any time, as well as the features included in Subscriptions. We reserve the right to stop issuing Subscriptions at any time and to set expiration dates for Subscriptions. Subscriptions may not be redeemed for any sum of money or monetary value. If you delete your account or your account is terminated for any reason, you will lose all unused Subscription time without refund or other compensation.

Virtual Currency and Gifts

When you purchase or receive Virtual Currency products such as Credits or Diamonds you do not own them. Instead, you receive a limited right to use them for eligible services and merchandise on MeetMe such as Boost, Spotlight, First Class Chats, and the purchase of virtual Gifts for other users.

You may use Credits to purchase Gifts for other users of our app or other apps which are visible to you. The price for each Gift will be displayed at the point of purchase. Gifts constitute a limited license to access a certain feature on the MeetMe platform when, as, and if allowed by us. All sales of Gifts are final and we do not offer refunds for any purchased Gifts. We are not responsible for repairing or replacing Gifts, or providing you with any credit or refund in the event that we modify, suspend, or terminate the Gift program, or for loss or damage due to any service error, or any other reason.

Disputes and Arbitration

You agree that any dispute relating in any way to these TOS or MeetMe, including without limitation your or third parties’ access to or use of MeetMe, will be resolved by binding arbitration as discussed below and not through litigation in any court (except in small claims court if the claim is within the court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual basis). Claims are subject to arbitration, regardless of what theory they are based on or whether they seek legal or equitable remedies. Arbitration applies to any and all such claims or disputes, whether they arose in the past, may currently exist, or may arise in the future. This arbitration agreement is entered into pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§1-16 (FAA).

YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IF YOU TELL US WITHIN 60 DAYS OF YOUR FIRST DOWNLOAD OR USE OF MEETME THAT YOU WANT TO OPT OUT. IF YOU WANT TO OPT OUT, SEND A WRITTEN NOTICE ADVISING US OF YOUR DECISION. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO HAVE A DISPUTE HEARD BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, OR OTHERWISE TO BE DECIDED BY A COURT OR GOVERNMENTAL TRIBUNAL.

YOU AGREE NOT TO (1) SEEK TO PROCEED ON ANY CLAIM IN ARBITRATION AS A CLASS CLAIM OR CLASS ACTION OR OTHER COMPARABLE REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (2) SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE IN ARBITRATION ANY CLAIMS INVOLVING SEPARATE CLAIMANTS; (3) BE PART OF, OR BE REPRESENTED IN, ANY CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION BROUGHT BY ANYONE ELSE; NOR (4) SEEK ANY AWARD OR REMEDY IN ARBITRATION AGAINST OR ON BEHALF OF ANYONE WHO IS NOT A NAMED PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION. IF THESE TERMS RELATING TO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEDURES ARE LEGALLY UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, THEN THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE WILL BE INAPPLICABLE TO THAT CLAIM, AND THAT CLAIM WILL INSTEAD BE HANDLED THROUGH LITIGATION IN COURT RATHER THAN BY ARBITRATION. NO ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE AUTHORITY TO ENTERTAIN ANY CLAIM ON BEHALF OF A PERSON WHO IS NOT A NAMED PARTY, NOR SHALL ANY ARBITRATOR HAVE AUTHORITY TO MAKE ANY AWARD FOR THE BENEFIT OF, OR AGAINST, ANY PERSON WHO IS NOT A NAMED PARTY.

Arbitration under these TOS and the Privacy Policy shall be conducted by a single arbitrator under the then current rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or JAMS, at the election of the party filing a claim in arbitration. That organization will apply its rules in effect at the time the arbitration claim is filed. If there is a conflict between those rules and this arbitration provision, this arbitration provision and the TOS will control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any current or future such rules or governing law, the arbitrator shall have no power to vary the terms of the TOS or to award either party attorneys’ fees. In the event that JAMS or the AAA is unable to handle the arbitration for any reason, then the matter shall be arbitrated by a neutral arbitrator selected by agreement of the parties, pursuant to the AAA rules of procedure.

The arbitrator’s award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

We will pay any costs that are required to be paid by us under the arbitration administrator’s rules. Even if not otherwise required, we will reimburse you up to $500 for any initial arbitration filing fees that you have paid. We will also pay any fees of the arbitrator and the arbitration administrator for the first two days of any hearing. If you win the arbitration, we will reimburse you for any fees you paid to the arbitration organization and/or arbitrator. All other fees will be allocated according to the arbitration administrator’s rules and applicable law. If you are unable to afford any fees that you would otherwise be required to pay, you may request us to pay or reimburse them, and we will consider your request.

Rules and forms for filing an arbitration claim can be found at www.jamsadr.com or www.adr.org. Arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district that includes your address at the time the arbitration is filed.

Permitted Time For Filing A Claim or Lawsuit

Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of MeetMe or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

How To Make Claims Of Copyright Or Other Intellectual Property Infringement

We respect the intellectual property of others and ask our users to do the same. We may, in our sole discretion, disable or terminate the accounts of users whom we believe may be infringing the intellectual property rights of others.

Miscellaneous

You may not use MeetMe where prohibited by law, and you agree to comply with all local rules regarding online conduct and acceptable content. These TOS are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to conflicts of laws principles. Our failure or delay to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found to be invalid by an arbitrator or pursuant to the disputes section above or a court of competent jurisdiction, you nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to our intentions as reflected in these TOS. The other provisions of the TOS shall remain in full force and effect.

Last updated: January 31, 2022

This document (“Privacy Policy”) explains the privacy rules applicable to all information collected or submitted when you access, install, or use the Nord Services.

All definitions and capitalized words used in this Privacy Policy are defined here or in our General Terms.

By visiting our websites, by submitting your personal data to us, and by accessing, installing and/or using the Services, you confirm that you have read this Privacy Policy and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you disagree with the rules of this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Services.

Information in this Privacy Policy is provided in layers, meaning that all information related to our general personal data processing practices is provided here. Meanwhile, additional Service-specific information applicable to separate Nord products or websites are accessible via links in this Privacy Policy.

Processing of your data

Nord processes user data to a limited scope – for provision of the Services, processing payments for the Services, as well as the functioning of our websites and mobile applications. We process the following basic information:

Information for creating your account

Email address. We ask for your email address as part of your registration. It is necessary for establishing a Nord account, retrieving a lost password, and using our Services.

Payment related information

Payment data (if using paid Services). This information is necessary to collect payments for our Services. In addition to the traditional payment methods, such as credit cards, users can buy our Service with cryptocurrency. Our payment processing partners process basic billing information for payment processing and refund requests (such as date of purchase, payer’s IP address, zip code, card owner's full name and credit card information). We also process some of the same payment information ourselves (e. g., card owner's full name, last few digits of your credit card) in cases of recurring payments.
Country details. When providing your payment details, we ask our users to provide the country where they are registered, have a permanent address or usually live. This information is necessary for VAT calculation purposes.

Communication data

Email address. We use your email address to: i) send you important updates and announcements related to your use of our Services; ii) respond to your requests or inquiries; iii) send you offers, surveys and other marketing content (you can opt-out of those at any time).
Communication optimization data. We use various tools to help us optimize our emailing campaigns. These tools may track events you perform with an email, such as open and unsubscribe. We may also be able to see the user device’s operating system (e.g., windows, mac, ios, android) in order to optimize push notifications.
Chat-bot. If you contact us via our chat-bot on our website, in addition to collecting your contact information, we will be able to see your IP address. This additional information is necessary for our support to determine the user's country and to see if the user is connected to our servers or not.

Information collected on our website

Access logs. As most websites on the internet, our website collects access logs (such as IP address, browser type, operating system) to operate our services and ensure their secure, reliable, and robust performance. This information is also essential for fighting against DDoS attacks, scanning and similar hacking attempts.
Cookies. Cookies, pixels and other similar technologies are usually small text or image files that are placed on your device when you visit our website. Some cookies are essential for our website to operate smoothly; others are used to improve website functionality or analyze aggregated usage statistics to improve website performance (as in the case of Google Analytics cookies). We also use affiliate cookies to identify the customers referred to the website by our partners so that we can grant the referrers their commission. You can check what cookies we use in the detailed cookie table that is accessible here.

Additional information per product

As our products cater to different user needs, they may collect different data points during their performance. The following links provide further information on:

NordVPN

NordPass

NordLocker

Sharing your personal data

We do not share your personal information with third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy.

Service providers. We use third-party service providers to help us with various operations, such as payment processing, email automation, website and app diagnostics, analytics and other. As a result, some of these providers may process personal information.

Some of our main long-term service providers:

Live chat and support service platform – Zendesk (provided by Zendesk Inc.);
Emailing service providers – Iterable (by Iterable Inc.), Sendgrid (by Twilio Inc.);
Application analytics and diagnostics – Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics (provided by Google);
AppsFlyer (by AppsFlyer Ltd.), Bugsnag (by Bugsnag Inc.);
Conversion attribution system – Hasoffers (provided by Tune Inc.);

Sometimes our service providers, for example, distributors, resellers, and app store partners, will be independent controllers of your data. Their terms and conditions and privacy policies will apply to such relationships.

Your personal information may be processed in any country in which we engage service providers. When you use our Services, you acknowledge the transfer of your personal information outside of the country where you reside.

Requests for data. Any request for user data should follow an appropriate official legal process to be recognized by the laws of the Republic of Panama (e.g., mutual legal assistance treaty, letters rogatory). We carefully review each request to make sure it satisfies laws applicable to our company, laws of requesting country, international norms and our internal policies. Being based in Panama allows us to keep no logs of users’ online activity (no IP addresses, browsing data, traffic information, etc.). This means that we are unable to link an individual user to a specific IP address, connection timestamp or other information that we do not collect. Therefore, even in cases we receive a rightfully served request, it might be impossible for us to identify a specific person or provide any identifying information related to that person. In cases where, following an appropriate legal process, we are able to identify a specific person, we will provide the limited data we process as per our Privacy Policy. Contact information for government authorities: nordvpn S.A., address PH F&F TOWER, 50th Street & 56th Street, Suite #32-D, Floor 32, Panama City, Republic of Panama, email inquiries@nordvpn.com.

Choices related to your data

If you’d like to edit your profile information, delete your account or data, or request to provide you with a copy of your personal information, please contact our support team. Please note that you may need to pass through a couple of account verification steps so that we can verify you are the owner of the account.

If you wish to unsubscribe from our communication, you can opt out at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each message or contacting us at privacy@nordaccount.com.

You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. To disable cookies, follow your browser’s instructions on how to block or clear cookies.

Some browsers have incorporated a “do-not-track” feature that can send a signal to the websites you visit, indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests.

If you disagree with the processing of your data by Nord, please do not use our Services. You can request us to discontinue processing your personal data, in which case your data will be processed only as much as it is necessary to effect the discontinuation of your use of the Services (e.g., final settlement, or deleting all personal data based on your email address), or finalizing other Nord’s legal relationship with you (e.g., record keeping, accounting, processing refunds).

If you wish to use the Services again, you will have to accept and agree to this Privacy Policy anew.

Pandora Privacy Policy

Last updated: July 1, 2021

Pandora operates a personalized Internet radio service and related platform features available through the web at pandora.com, on mobile devices and tablets, in automobiles, and through other consumer electronic devices (the ""Pandora Service"" or ""Service""). As used in this policy, ""Pandora"" refers to Pandora Media, LLC and its subsidiaries. This policy applies to all Pandora-authorized operations of the Service. We may refer to Pandora as ""we"", ""us"", or ""our"". We may refer to you as ""listener"", ""you"", or ""your"". The purpose of this policy is to inform you about the personal information we collect, how we use and share that information, and the ways in which you can control how we use and share that information. By using our Service, you agree to the terms of this policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this policy.

1. Information We Receive or Collect from You
Registration Data 

: When you register, we ask you to provide certain information, which includes your email address, birth year, gender, and zip code (the ""Registration Data""), as well as a password for your account.

Payment Information 

: If you choose to subscribe to fee-based portions of the Service, purchase a subscription to the Service as a gift, or purchase add-on products or services, you will also be asked to provide (at a minimum) your name and payment information (""Payment Information"").

Information You Choose to Provide to Pandora 

: You have the ability to provide a variety of information during your interactions with us and the Pandora Service, such as emails you may send us, ads you respond to, and emails or newsletters that you sign up to receive. Pandora or third parties acting on our behalf receive data from you whenever you provide us with information.

Listening Activity 

: When you use the Service, we keep track of your listening activity, which may include the number and title of songs you have listened to, the songs that you like (thumb up) or dislike (thumb down), the stations and playlists you create or listen to, the songs you skip, and how long you listen.

Community Posting 

: You have the ability to post comments, images, and information in community networking features available on or accessible through the Service, such as Pandora Community, your public profile, artist and album forums, our blog, and our social networking pages. You should be aware that any information you submit in the course of these community activities can be read, collected, or used by other users of these parts of the Service, as further discussed below. We are not responsible for the information you choose to make public in any of the community networking features available on or through the Service.

Technical Information 

: As is true of many internet-enabled services, Pandora may collect certain technical information through the use of log files and servers. Web and application servers create log files automatically as part of their setup and configuration. Information in a log file may include IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, date/time stamps, Media Access Control (MAC) address, file requested, and other usage information and statistics.

Contact Information 

: If you choose to participate in research studies, or sign up for certain features and/or rewards offered through the Service, you may provide us, and we may collect, your contact information, including your name, mailing address, and phone number (""Contact Information""). The email address you provided as part of your Registration Data is not considered Contact Information for the purposes of this policy.

Device Information 

: If you access and use the Service from a computer, mobile phone, tablet, automobile, or other electronic device, we may collect information about those devices. For example, our servers receive and store information about your computer and browser, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, and other related software or hardware information. If you access the Service from a mobile phone, tablet, automobile, or other electronic device, we may collect and store information such as device type, operating system version and type, unique identifiers (such as mobile advertising ID, VIN, and MAC address), carrier, and other related information for that device.

Location Information 

: When you register for the Pandora Service, you provide us with your zip or postal code. We may also collect location information from devices you use while accessing the Pandora Service. Depending on the device and operating system, device-based location information may be derived from GPS and nearby wireless signals such as cell towers, Wi-Fi networks, and Bluetooth beacons. We will not collect your device-based location information unless you have permitted the Pandora app to access location services on your device. You can disable this access at any time in your system settings. Additionally, in some cases, your location within a geographic block may be approximated from the IP address currently assigned to your device.

Voice Data 

: If you grant microphone access to the Pandora app on your device, we will receive your voice data when you interact with a voice feature on our app. You can perform a search or control Pandora with your voice by tapping on the microphone icon in the search bar, or by using the wake word ""Hey Pandora"" if you have enabled ""Listen for 'Hey Pandora'"" in your app settings. Ad-supported listeners can also use their voice to interact with select audio advertisements, in which case an audible tone will sound when the microphone opens and closes, and an indicator will display on your screen. For more information about Pandora's voice features, see this FAQ.

Research 

: If you choose to participate in surveys or other research, we will collect any information you choose to provide us, together with other data about your use of the Pandora Service.

Third Party Personal Information: 

Certain features of our Service require you to provide personal information about another person. By providing another person's personal information to us, you confirm that you have all necessary rights and permissions to provide such information. If you choose to provide this information, we may store and use the information for purposes of providing those features. For example, if you choose to purchase a subscription to the Service for a friend, we may ask for your friend's name and email address to provide the gift. We will only use this information for the specific reason for which it was provided or for security purposes, such as to prevent fraud. If you believe that one of your contacts has provided us with your personal information and you would like to request that it be removed from our database, please contact us at privacy @ pandora.com.

2. Information We Receive or Collect from Third Parties

We may receive or collect information about you from third parties, and combine and store it on our servers with other information we may have already received or collected from you. These third parties include:

Service providers that provide or make available advertising, features and functionality, and content on or through the Service.
Advertising entities such as advertisers and advertising agencies that collect and maintain information on their customers. These third parties may provide Pandora with certain information about those customers for the purposes of serving advertisements and/or marketing offers to their customers on the Pandora Service.
Marketing companies and data providers that create, maintain, and distribute professional marketing lists or segments, or maintain and distribute other marketing, or similar data.
Governmental or quasi-governmental agencies or organizations that provide or make available, to the public, census and demographic data.
Third-party social media websites, applications, or services that you use, when we allow those websites, applications, or services to interact through the Service to provide personalized services to you. In some cases, those websites, applications, or services may automatically provide us with information about you to facilitate personalization unless you use the controls available on those websites, applications, or services to opt-out of such sharing.
People who store or post information about you on the community features of the Pandora Service, or by your enabling connectivity with another website, application, or service where friends or other listeners store such information. For instance, your friends may store information about you in places such as their friend lists, address books, or photos on our Service or other websites, applications, or services such as social media applications with which the Pandora Service interacts.

Pandora is not responsible for, and will assume no liability, if a business partner or other entity collects, uses, or shares any information about you in violation of its own privacy policy or any applicable laws, rules, or agreements.

Related Companies 

: We may also receive information about you from our parent corporation, Sirius XM Radio Inc. (""Sirius XM"") and its subsidiaries. For more information about Sirius XM, please see https://www.siriusxm.com/corporate.

3. Information Collection Technologies
Our use of cookies 

: Pandora uses a technology that is commonly known as ""cookies."" A cookie is a file our server writes to your hard drive that contains an alphanumeric identifier. We use the identifier in a cookie to help us manage and report on your interaction with the Service. Through cookies, we are able to collect information that we use to improve the Service, keep count of return visits to our website or our advertisers' or partners' websites, collect and report on aggregate statistical information, authenticate your login credentials, or manage multiple instances of the Service in a single browser. We may also collect other data such as the page or site that referred you to the Service, the date and time you visited the Service, and your current IP address. For example, we use Google Analytics to help us understand how users engage with the Pandora Service. For more information about Google Analytics and how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please visit https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.

The cookies we place on your hard drive are known as ""first-party cookies."" We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You may be able to remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your browser's ""help"" section. If you do not accept first-party cookies you may still use our Service, but your ability to use some areas of our website, and the ability to stay logged in, will be limited.

Advertisers' and other third parties' use of cookies 

: Advertisers and other third-party advertising entities that deliver ads to you on the Service may place or recognize a unique cookie on your hard drive. These types of non-Pandora cookies are known as ""third-party cookies."" Advertising entities may use third-party cookies in order to collect information about you, which may include how many times you have seen their ads or whether you have interacted with an ad. They may also use third-party cookies to provide you with interest-based advertising. Most major web browsers provide users with the option to accept or reject third-party cookies. The use of third-party cookies is not covered by this privacy policy. We do not have access to or control over cookies placed by advertisers and other third parties. If you would like to review and modify your interest-based advertising settings, visit Your Advertising Choices on Pandora.

Beacons and tracking pixels 

: Pandora, third-party advertising entities, and tracking-utility partners employ a technology known as ""beacons"" or ""tracking pixels"" (each, a ""Beacon""). A Beacon is a one-pixel-by-one-pixel clear image that is embedded in HTML content, and is about the size of a period at the end of a sentence. When HTML content containing a Beacon is rendered, the Beacon transmits information to a server, such as a numeric count, unique identifier, or IP address. Pandora and its partners use Beacons to help us better manage content on our Service. For example, we may place a Beacon in HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened, or on a webpage to count the number of unique visitors to that page. The use of a Beacon may also allow us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and of our marketing campaigns.

HTML5 and Flash Local Storage 

: Pandora and its advertising and technology partners may, in some instances, use HTML5 and/or Flash Local Storage (collectively, ""Local Storage"") to enhance your listening and advertising experiences on the Service. For example, we use Local Storage to keep track of the current song playing in the event your browser window reloads inadvertently, that way we can continue playing that song starting at the same position it was prior to reload. Our advertising and technology partners may use Local Storage to detect your bandwidth speeds for optimal video playback performance. Each browser implements HTML5 Local Storage differently and provides tools for managing content stored within local storage. You can review your browser's privacy settings to manage the content stored within HTML5 Local Storage. Similarly, for more information on how to manage content stored with Flash Local Storage, please review this document provided by Adobe.

4. How We Use Information We Receive or Collect
Generally 

: Pandora may use your Registration Data and other information or data we receive or collect, as well as data we derive or infer from combinations of the foregoing, for a variety of purposes, such as:

To facilitate the creation of and secure your account on the Pandora Service.
To provide and improve the Pandora Service, and to develop new products and services.
To customize and personalize the advertising and other content we deliver to you both on the Service and on other services offered by our publishing partners. We use this information to provide you with relevant and interesting advertising and other content.
To measure and analyze Service usage and enhance the listener experience on our Service. We use tracking information to determine how well each page and station performs overall, based on aggregate listener demographics and traffic patterns to those pages and stations. This helps us continue to build a better Service for you.
To fulfill your requests for certain products and services, such as distributing electronic newsletters and enabling you to participate in and renew paid services, surveys, and public forums.
To send you information that you requested or agreed to receive.
To alert you to the latest developments and features on our Service and to notify you of administrative information, such as security or support and maintenance advisories.
To invite you to participate in events or special promotions related to artists or products we think you may like or in which you may be interested.
To pay artists and rights owners for tracks you hear, by reporting aggregated or deidentified listening information to copyright owners and licensing agencies.
To conduct and support research and publication around the art and science of sound and music, and the connections they inspire, as well as other areas of technological advancement pertinent to our products and services.
Push Notifications 

: We may send you push notifications from time to time in order to update you about events and promotions. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level in your app settings. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.

Email Address 

: We do not sell or give your email address to other companies for their own marketing purposes without your permission. However, we may use your email address or other Registration Data to provide you with technical support, send you notices about the Service or other promotional offers you have elected to receive, and to serve you with ads that are more relevant to your interests. We may also work with data partners and advertising platforms to help increase the relevance of ads we provide to our listeners. In doing so, we may use information representing an encrypted or hashed value derived from information we have received, such as your email address, in connection with these partners and platforms.

Contact Information 

: We do not sell or give your Contact Information to companies for their own marketing purposes without your permission. We do use Contact Information, however, to contact you, and to provide you with special offers and other information. If you provided your Contact Information as part of your use of Pandora's Artist Marketing Platform, we may use your Contact Information to update you on new features and functionality made available as part of the Artist Marketing Platform, or the status of your content submission. You may at any time request that we cease using your Contact Information by contacting User Support.

5. How We Share Information We Receive or Collect with Others
Related Companies 

: We share information we collect with our parent corporation, Sirius XM and its subsidiaries for the purposes described in our respective privacy policies, and to offer, provide, and improve services and products offered both individually and jointly with other Sirius XM companies. Sirius XM's privacy policy is available at www.siriusxm.com/privacy. Additionally, we may share your personal information, with our successor in interest in the event of a corporate reorganization, merger, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.

How Your Information Is Shared 

: Pandora may share information we receive or collect in a variety of ways, such as:

When you give Pandora permission through an affirmative election (for example, clicking ""yes"" in response to a message such as ""share my email with this advertiser"").
When you participate in community and social networking features on the Pandora Service, such as Pandora Community, forums, listener opinions and reviews, or other forms of communication and interaction which you elect to make public or share on public profiles or in other public forums.
If we contract or partner with third parties to provide specialized services on our behalf, such as credit card processors, customer support, ad servers or other providers of advertising services, platform technology providers, bulk email processors who send out emails on our behalf, or parties who assist us with sweepstakes management and prize fulfillment. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to Pandora. They are not authorized to use your personal information for their own, unrelated purposes.
Sharing information about the artists, tracks, stations, and playlists you have created or listened to via the Service, or that are associated with your account, if you have elected to share that information publicly. If your Pandora profile is marked as private, your stations may appear in a search, but your profile will not be linked to that station; however, if someone already knows and enters your entire email address into our search system, they will be able to see a list of all the stations created under that email address.
If you elect to take advantage of certain features or services provided jointly by Pandora and third parties, we may share certain information about you with those third parties for account authentication and management, and to enable the Service on their platforms. For example, when you elect to use products, services, features, or functionality, such as Google Now or Pandora for Business, provided by third-party partners, such as Google or Mood Media (respectively), you agree that we may provide certain data about you to those partners in order to enable the product, service, feature, or functionality you intend to use. As another example, when you share information through integrated social networking platforms, such as Facebook, you are agreeing to allow the Pandora service to communicate or ""talk"" with the other service in order to make the social features available for your use. These service providers may have their own data collection, use, and sharing practices that may also be applicable to your personal information, and that are not covered by this policy. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of those third-party service providers and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policies of the third-party service providers and the methods they use for changing the privacy or sharing settings on such services.
If you have given permission to a third party for us to share data about you with them. For example, if you participate as a panelist in a survey with an analytics company, you may, as part of your agreement with that company, have authorized that company to receive data from us about you.
To measure and analyze Service usage. For example, we use third-party providers such as Nielsen and ScorecardResearch to measure how long and how frequently you are using the Service. Advertising entities may use these providers to measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. When we use these providers, we provide them with information such as device identifier.
Legal and Security Purposes 

: We may share your information in order to (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of Pandora, or the legal rights of third parties, employees, agents, and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of Pandora users or members of the public including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) protect against fraud or to conduct risk management; or (iv) comply with the law, legal process, or legal and government requests.

Sharing of Device Information 

: Pandora may share information we gather from devices you use to access the Service with its third-party vendors or service providers, manufacturers or distributors, or advertising entities. We share this information for a variety of purposes such as mobile listening capping, advertising frequency capping, tracking advertising conversion events, estimating the number of unique users, security and fraud detection, debugging problems with the Pandora Service, and for providing you with more relevant advertisements.

Sharing of Deidentified, Aggregated, or Anonymized Information 

: Pandora may share with third parties, advertisers, and/or business partners deidentified, aggregated, or anonymized information we receive or collect, such as demographic information, location information, information about the computer or device from which you access the Service, or information about your interactions with the Service. We share such information for a variety of reasons, such as to analyze Service usage, improve the Service and your listener experience, improve the serving of advertisements, or for other similar purposes.

Information You Disclose in a Public Profile or in Public Forums 

: The Pandora Service offers publicly accessible and available profile pages, Pandora Community, community forums (such as artist, song, or advertiser pages), blogs, and pages on social media platforms. You should be aware that any information you provide or post in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. If your profile is public, any information you place in your user profile, including biographical information, the people you are following, and the people whom you allow to follow you, may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of such information from our public forums, contact our User Support team. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. To find out more about how to make your profile private, please see the section below on Pandora Profile Visibility.

Data Sharing 

: If your personal information is transferred or shared as described in this policy, we will seek assurances from the recipients of such information (prior to the transfer) that they will safeguard the information in a manner consistent with this policy. We ask recipients of such information to enter into a contractual relationship with us that includes confidentiality and non-disclosure clauses, and provides the same level of commitment to and protections of information as provided in this policy.

6. Advertising & Measurement Settings
Opting Out of Behavioral Advertising on the Web 

: In our effort to provide you with advertisements that may interest you, Pandora and third-party advertising entities use data in the manner disclosed in this policy to provide you with relevant ads. To learn about how the online advertising industry uses information it collects to provide you with relevant ads, and to control whether you want to receive those relevant ads from third-party advertisers, please review the information at the following links:

Your Advertising Choices on Pandora
AdChoices
Understanding Online Advertising (About Our Ads)

Because we do not control the privacy practices of third-party advertising companies, you should read and understand their privacy policies. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for reviewing the privacy policies of such third-party advertising companies and the methods available, if any, for changing privacy settings and the like.

Opting Out of Behavioral Advertising on Mobile and Tablet Devices: 

If you are using an iOS-based device and do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements that relate to your interests, you may be able to limit these advertisements by enabling ""Limit Ad Tracking"" on your iOS Device following these instructions from Apple.

If you are using an Android-based device and you do not wish to receive tailored in-application advertisements, you can visit Google's Ads Settings page from a browser on your Android-based device and make your choices there.

Pandora does not control the applicable platform operator-supplied ad settings, which may be updated or removed in accordance with each platform operator's respective policy. You should contact the platform operator if these options are no longer available.

Opting Out of Third Party Service Measurement and Analytics 

: As disclosed in this policy, we use third-party providers to aid us in measuring and analyzing service usage. You may opt out of web-based participation in these measurement services by following the instructions on the following web pages for each respective company: Nielsen and Scorecard Research. To opt-out of participation on mobile and tablet devices, please follow the instructions above listed in the section for Opting Out of Behavioral Advertising on Mobile and Tablet Devices.

7. Managing Your Information
Modification of Your Registration Data 

: We provide you with the ability to access and modify your Registration Data, which you may do through the Settings section of our Service or by contacting User Support. For detailed instructions on how to modify your Registration Data or to otherwise access this information, visit help.pandora.com. We generally respond to help requests within 24 hours of receiving a request, but it may take up to 30 days depending on the volume of requests we receive.

Retention of Your Registration Data and other Information 

: We will retain and use your Registration Data and the other information we collect about you for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services. We will retain and use this information for the purposes for which it was collected (as specified in this policy or as Pandora discloses to its listeners outside of this policy), including, to provide the Service to you, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

If you would like to delete your Registration Data, or if you would like more information on cancelling or deactivating your account, see the section below on Cancellation or Deactivation of Accounts.

Your Email Preferences 

: When you register for the Service, you may elect to receive promotional, marketing, or other similar emails tailored to your interests. You have the option to change this election in your account settings. For information on how to opt in or out of receiving promotional, marketing, or other similar emails from us, visit help.pandora.com.

Additionally, you may also follow the unsubscribe instructions contained in the promotional, marketing, or other similar emails you receive.

We will send you transaction confirmation emails and other Service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our Service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.

Cancellation or Deactivation of Accounts 

: If you would like to request the cancellation or deactivation of your account, you should contact our User Support team for assistance. Cancellation or deactivation of your account does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information you may have posted or otherwise made available publicly on the Service while you were a registered user. You should also contact our User Support team to request the deactivation of a profile you believe is fake or otherwise unauthorized.

Pandora Profile Visibility 

: When you register for the Pandora Service, your profile and listening activity will be public. When the visibility of your Pandora profile is set to public, the Service automatically publishes your listening activity to your profile. For example, if you create a new station or thumb up a song, that activity will be posted in your Pandora profile for members of the public to view. We provide you with the ability to change the degree of visibility of your Pandora profile. For detailed instructions on how to adjust your Pandora profile visibility settings, visit help.pandora.com.

Please note that changes to the visibility of your Pandora profile do not have any impact on the advertising you may see if you use the ad-supported version of the Service.

Cached Profiles on Search Engines 

: Although we may deactivate your account or make your profile private at your request, Internet search engines such as Google and Bing cache publicly available webpages for a period of time beyond the control of Pandora, and may make your deactivated or formerly public profile available to users of their services on their platforms until such time as they refresh their webpage cache. Please consult with the applicable search engine to determine how you may remove webpages from their webpage cache.

8. Security and Content from Other Websites
Protection of Data from Loss 

: We have implemented security measures designed to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information we collect or receive from you. For example, when you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. If you have any questions about security on our Service, you can contact our User Support team.

Data Integrity 

: We use the information we collect in ways that are relevant and compatible with the purpose for which that information was collected or provided to us as disclosed in this policy. We will take steps to ensure that all information collected, processed, and/or stored is protected from destruction, corruption, or use in a manner inconsistent with our policies or the purpose for which we received it.

Links to Other Websites 

: Our Service and certain advertisements on our Service include links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Pandora. If you submit personal information to any of those websites, the privacy statements and practices of those websites govern their use of your information. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit.

Use of Framing Techniques 

: Some of our third-party partners may utilize framing techniques to serve content to and from webpages accessible through our Service while preserving the look and feel of our website. Please be aware that if a third-party partner utilizes framing techniques, you are providing your personal information to this third-party partner and not to Pandora.

9. Our Policies Concerning Children

Pandora prohibits registration by, and does not knowingly collect personal information from, anyone under 13 years of age. In the event we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected information from children under the age of 13, we will take measures to remove such information from our servers.

Privacy Policy

Our mission is to empower visual storytellers. When you use our services, you’re entrusting us with your information, and we understand this is a big responsibility. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and what choices you have. If you have any questions, you can always email us at privacy@picsart.com.






Information we collect
	

Information you share with us or give us permission to obtain

When you create an account we collect the information you provide us through text fields, such as your first and last name, email address, username, and password. We also require data about your location, which we approximate from your IP address or device settings. We use all of this to securely set up your account and provide our services to you.

You may also have the option to share demographic information about yourself, such as your gender, age, and preferred language, which we collect to make Picsart more relevant to you. 

We also collect visual information through the images that you post to our services, including your profile photos.

With your permission (on download or within one of our apps), we may access and store your device's contact list to help you find your friends on Picsart, invite them to Picsart, or to share your content with them. If you connect your Facebook, Instagram, or other third-party accounts to Picsart, we use information from those accounts (like your user name, friends, or contacts) for the same purpose. You can choose to stop sharing that information with us at any time by going to Facebook, Instagram, or other third-party account and removing our access.

We may also collect information about others if you use Picsart to upload, share or distribute content that contains information about them, including their name, image, and contact information. With your prior explicit consent, we may also collect information about others from third party platforms such as social media sites, for example when you log in to Picsart using the login information of other social media sites.

We also get technical information when you use Picsart

When you use a website or mobile application like ours, certain internet and electronic network activity information gets created and logged automatically.  These are the types of technical information we collect:

Log data. Our servers passively keep an electronic record of your interactions with our services, which we call ""log data"". For example, when you visit our website, sign into our services, or browse content, we collect data about these interactions that includes where you navigate within our website and apps, your IP address, browser type and settings, the date and time of your visit, search terms, which elements of our site and services you use the most, device data, and cookie data. We use log data to operate our services, maintain security, ensure reliable performance, and improve your experience on Picsart.

Cookie data. We use ""cookies""  and similar technologies to collect log data and operate our services. You can learn more about how we use cookies in ""cookies"" below.

Device data. We collect and combine data about the devices you use to access Picsart, and data about your device usage and activity.

Metadata of visual information.  We collect the metadata linked to your content. For example, your images may be accompanied by additional content like a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords), comments, or a geotag. This makes your content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using others' APIs, then the latitude and longitude coordinates may be stored with the photo and may be searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if you make your photo publicly viewable.

TrueDepth API. If you have an Apple iOS device and use the camera function with our services, we may automatically collect data about the spatial positioning of a person’s head or face within an image frame using Apple’s TrueDepth API. We use this data in real time so you can apply effects and use other editing tools. None of the data collected via TrueDepth API ever leaves your device, it isn’t persistently stored on your device, and it isn’t shared with third parties.





How we use the information we collect, and legal bases for use
	

We process your information:

To fulfill a contract, or take steps linked to a contract, including:

Receive, process, and confirm your subscription or registration, and communicate with you about your account.

Allow you to sign in to your account.

Verify your identity.

As required to conduct our business and pursue our legitimate business interests, in particular:

Provide you with our services, and display content you create and post on our services and social media.

Help you when you make customer service requests.

Protect Picsart, our services, and community.

Prevent fraud, abuse, and other misconduct on Picsart.

Help us diagnose technical and service problems and administer our website and apps.

Conduct research and development (e.g. by conducting user surveys) to improve Picsart and develop future products.

Promote your Picsart account for greater discoverability.

Understand how you use the service, to create a better experience for you and other users. This includes making inferences, like what content you may be interested in, based on how you use the service.  For example, if you frequently save illustrations of penguins to your collections, we may infer you have a preference for graphic art over photographic content, or that you are interested in flightless birds.

When required, with your consent:

Market Picsart services and deliver targeted advertising to you, unless you opt out, as controlled by your email and privacy preferences.

Send cookies or similar technologies to your device, as described in “cookies and similar technologies” below.

For legal reasons:

Verify your identity to comply with law.



How and when we share your information
	

Your Picsart profile and the posts you make are publicly accessible, which means anyone can see your profile photo, name, and description about yourself if you add that information. Creators you follow, creators who follow you, likes, and comments you make are also publicly accessible. We share your information with:

At your direction, services like Facebook, Instagram, or Dropbox so that you can link your Picsart account and publish content to those services.

Service providers we use to process information on our behalf, for the purposes we describe in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may contract with businesses for web hosting and maintenance, security and spam detection, data storage, and analytics and advertising (both described further below). We only engage businesses we believe are trustworthy and who have confirmed their privacy practices are consistent with ours, and we only provide the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf. Each service provider must agree to use reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information involved, in order to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Service providers may only use your personal information in ways we specify.

Government and law enforcement bodies. We share information when we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with law, regulation, or legal request; to protect the safety, property, or rights of the public, Picsart, or any third party; or to detect, prevent, or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity.

Our subsidiaries and affiliates. We share your personal data with our subsidiaries in order to provide our services to you. We require that our subsidiaries protect your personal information consistent with this privacy policy. If we were to engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other transaction that involves the transfer of the information described in this Privacy Policy, we may share your information with the parties involved in that transaction.



Cookies and similar technologies
	

We use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer or mobile device to identify your computer and web browser) and may use anonymous identifiers (random strings of characters that are used for the same purposes as cookies). Some cookies are ""session cookies"" that last until you close your browser, and others are ""persistent cookies"" that last until you or your browser deletes them.

We use cookies and similar technologies to analyze use of and improve our website and services, to see which areas and features of the website are most popular, to count the number of devices accessing the website, to personalize your experience, and to remember your preferences as described in ""Interest-based advertising"".  For example, we use cookies to store your language preferences or other settings so you don‘t have to set them up every time you visit Picsart. 

Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.  You can set your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent; however, certain features of the website or services may not work if you delete or disable cookies.  Some of our service providers may use their own cookies, anonymous identifiers, or other tracking technology in connection with the services they perform on our behalf.



Analytics services
	

We use third-party analytics service providers such as Google Analytics, Google’s Crashlytics and Firebase services, and Facebook. We may disclose your site use information to these analytics providers to help us learn more about how you and others use our services:

To learn more about Google Analytics and how to opt out, visit https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881?hl=en

To learn more about how Facebook uses your data, log on to your Facebook account and access your settings, or visit https://www.facebook.com/help/325807937506242/



Interest-based advertising
	

We may partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers that serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated platforms. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information ad networks and ad serving providers collect about your use of our website and other sites or apps over time, including information about relationships among different browsers and devices. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising.


We adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance (""DAA"") Self-Regulatory Principles in connection with this interest-based advertising activity. Visit the DAA Webchoices tool at www.aboutads.info to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt out of this advertising on websites by companies participating in the DAA self-regulatory program, and http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for mobile apps. If you delete your cookies or use a different browser or mobile device, you may need to renew your opt out choices exercised through the DAA Webchoices tool. Electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. Additionally, your browser may offer tools to limit the use of cookies or to delete cookies; however, if you use these tools, our website may not function as intended. Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative. To learn more about the Network Advertising Initiative and your opt-out options for their members, see the NAI Consumer Opt Out.

We support the ad industry’s 2009 Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising and expect that ad networks we directly engage to serve you interest-based advertising will do so as well, though we cannot guarantee their compliance. We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.

We also provide you with additional tools to opt out of marketing from us, which you can learn about in ""Your options"" below.



Your options
	

If you have registered for an account, you can access, review, and update your personal information by logging into your account on the Picsart app and going to your profile. When logged into your account, you can also update your notification preferences, manage your linked devices, toggle contact syncing, and make other changes to your preferences in the app settings.

On your iOS or Android device you can open the Settings app to change the camera, photos, and other permissions you grant Picsart, ad tracking, and other settings.

You can opt out of receiving marketing emails by using the ""unsubscribe"" link or other means specified in marketing emails you receive from us. However, you cannot opt out of receiving all emails from us, such as service announcements and emails about the status of your account.

For interest-based advertising, you can visit the DAA Webchoices tool at www.aboutads.info to learn how to opt out, and http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for mobile apps. You can also visit the NAI Consumer Opt Out to learn more about the Network Advertising Initiative and your opt-out options.

You can adjust your cookie preferences here.



Our policy on children's information
	

You are not allowed to use our services if you are under the age of 13, and our services are not directed at children under the age of 13.

If we become aware that we have received personal Information from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information and terminate the person’s account



International transfer
	

We operate worldwide, and we may move, process, and store your data in the United States and any other country where we operate, which may be outside the country where you live. Not all data protection laws are the same. Some countries where we transfer personal data may allow government authorities greater access than your country does.

See the section for EU and UK residents below to learn more about data transfers to and from that region.



European Union and UK residents
	

If you reside in the UK or another member state of the European Union, you have certain rights under EU data protection legislation. You can ask us to:

Confirm we process your personal data, and ask what personal data we have about you.

Change or fix your data.

Delete your data.

Stop using some or all of your data if we have no legal right to keep using it.

Give you a copy of personal data you provided to us, in machine readable format.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please visit privacy.picsart.com or email us at privacy@picsart.com. You are not required to pay any charge for exercising your rights. If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you think we haven’t complied with data protection laws, you also have a right to file a complaint with your local data protection authority.

The data controller for Picsart’s website and services is PicsArt, Inc., a Delaware company with its registered office at One Market Street, Floor 32, San Francisco, CA 94105. Our data protection officer may be reached at DPO@picsart.com.

To verify your identity when you make a request, you must provide us with your email address and respond to an email verification request. We will match that information to the information we have in our systems.

Because Picsart is a worldwide service, we may transfer the personal data of EU residents to a country outside of the EU and the UK. When we do, we do so under the EU’s model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries (known as ""standard contractual clauses"").

When you register for an account, we process and retain most personal information we have about you for as long as you are a user of our services. When you close your account, we begin deleting certain personal information that we no longer have a business reason to retain. We may be required to retain certain information about you, such as when there is a legal requirement to do so.



California residents
	

If you are a California resident, you have the following rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act and California Privacy Rights Act:

You have the right to know what personal information we have collected about you in the preceding 12 months, including sources, purpose of collection, and third parties we have shared it with.

You can ask us to delete your personal information.

You can ask us not to share or sell your information with any third party.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please visit privacy.picsart.com. Alternatively, you can email us at privacy@picsart.com to submit your request. You must use ""California Request to Know Information"", ""California Right to Know Categories,"" ""California Right to Delete,"" or ""California Right on Opt out of Sale"" in the subject line of your email, as appropriate. You must provide us with your first name, last name, phone number, and the email address you used when you created your Picsart account, if applicable. Each request must be sent separately.

To fulfill your requests, we must be able to verify your identity in our systems against the identity you provide. You’ll need to provide us with your email address and respond to an email verification request, so we can match that information to the information we have in our systems.

To designate an authorized agent to act on your behalf, you must send a signed, written authorization containing your first name, last name, email address, and phone number to:

PicsArt, Inc.
Attn: Legal
One Market Street, Floor 32
San Francisco, CA 94105

We will process your request in an efficient manner, but we may not be able to delete your personal information (i) if we have to complete an ongoing transaction with you, (ii) if we detect or need to address a data security incident, (iii) in order to correct or repair an error, (iv) in order to protect against fraudulent or illegal activity, (iv) in order to comply with a legal requirement, or (v) if we use it internally in a lawful manner to improve our services. We will also maintain a record of your requests. If we delete your personal information, many of our services will not work the same for you. For example, your previous opt-out requests will not be saved, your account will be deleted, any edited photos, videos, or other media will be deleted, and saved preferences and information will no longer be available.

We participate in digital advertising networks to deliver advertising tailored to your interests. Participation in certain ad networks may constitute a ""sale"" of personal information under CCPA. To opt out of this activity, please visit optout.aboutads.info and optout.networkadvertising.org. The information we share with advertising networks includes identifiers, characteristics of protected classifications under California and federal law, internet and electronic activity, commercial information, and inferences we draw from information to create a profile about you to reflect your preferences, characteristics, behavior and attitudes.

California users under the age of 18 may request the removal of their content publicly posted in our services by emailing us at privacy@picsart.com. You will need to describe the content you want removed in enough detail to allow us to locate it, or we may not be able to process your request. In some cases, complete removal of your content may not be possible because your content may have been reposted (in whole or in part) by other users. We do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under the age of 16.



How we make changes to this policy
	

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect our current practices and ensure compliance with applicable laws, so please check back frequently for changes. The most current version will always be at https://www.picsart.com/privacy. If we make material changes, we may notify you through other methods as required by law, such as at picsart.com, in our mobile applications, by sending email to the email address associated with your account, or by push notifications to your device if you’ve enabled them. If you continue to use Picsart after those changes are in effect, you agree to the new policy.

Privacy Policy

Last Updated: May 24, 2018

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the manner in which Cloudary Holdings Limited, operating the Webnovel service (“Webnovel”, “we,” or “us”) and our websites www.webnovel.com (the “Site”), as well as all related websites, networks, applications, and other services provided by us and on which a link to this Policy is displayed (collectively, together with the Site, our “Service”) collect, use, disclose and otherwise process Personal Information. “Personal Information” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. This Policy, which is incorporated into and is subject to the Webnovel Terms of Service, describes the information that we gather from you on the Service, how we use and disclose such information, and the steps we take to protect such information.

1. Personal Information We Collect:

We may collect Personal Information about you from various sources described below. Where applicable, we indicate whether and why you must provide us with your Personal Information, as well as the consequences of failing to do so. If you do not provide Personal Information when requested, you may not be able to benefit from our Service if that information is necessary to provide you with it or if we are legally required to collect it.

User-provided Information. When you use the Service, we ask you to provide certain Personal Information about you, including your name, gender, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card or other billing information, your date of birth, geographic area, or preferences and we may link this information with other information about you. For example, we may ask you to provide us with Personal Information when you register for an account, use the Service, or make a purchase on the Service.

We may also collect any other Personal Information that you choose to provide to us. For example, if you decide to contact us with a request, we will process the content of your message, the date and time of your message, our response and any other Personal Information you provide in that context. If you contact us to apply for a job with Webnovel, we will process your job application, including your curriculum vitae and other Personal Information you submit to us in that context.

Automatically Collected Information. When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. We may also automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear gifs"" or “web beacons.” In this context, we may collect certain information about you, such as your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users, and may be connected with other information about you.

Please review your web browser “Help"" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential. We may use third party cookies on our Service as well. For instance, we use Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data. Google provides some additional privacy options described at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ regarding Google Analytics cookies.

Webnovel does not process or respond to web browsers’ “do not track” signals or other similar transmissions that indicate a request to disable online tracking of users who visit our Site or who use our Service.

Location Information. We may obtain information about your physical location, such as by use of GPS and other geolocation features in your device, or by inference from other information we collect (for example, your IP address indicates the general geographic region from which you are connecting to the Internet).
Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons. We may display third-party content on the Service, including third-party advertising. Third-party content may use cookies, web beacons, or other mechanisms for obtaining data in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may function as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through third-party web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by Webnovel. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.
Information from Other Sources. We may obtain information from third parties and sources other than the Service, such as our partners and advertisers.
Publicly accessible sources. We may collect information about you, such as [Google, Facebook, Twitter] from publicly accessible sources, including [username, avatar, location].

2. How We Use the Personal Information We Collect.

We use information we collect on the Service in a variety of ways in providing the Service and operating our business, including the following:

We use the Personal Information that we collect on the Service to operate, maintain, enhance and provide all features of the Service, to provide services and information that you request, to respond to comments and questions and otherwise to provide support to users, to contact you for administrative purposes such as customer service, and to process and deliver entries and rewards in connection with promotions that may be offered from time to time on the Service.
We use the Personal Information that we collect on the Service to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the Service, and to develop new products, services, features, and functionality.
We may use your email address or other Personal Information we collect to send marketing communications, including updates on promotions and events, relating to products and services offered by us and by third parties.

We may use cookies and automatically collected Personal Information to:

(i) personalize our Service, such as remembering information about you so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service;
(ii) provide customized advertisements, content, and information;
(iii) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of the Service and third-party marketing activities;
(iv) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed;
(v) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities on the Service.

If you are located in the European Economic Area, we only process your Personal Information based on a valid legal ground, including: consent (where you have given consent), contract (where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you, for example to deliver the Services or respond to your inquiries), our or a third party’s legitimate interests (for example, to personalize our Services and provide you with tailored content, conduct business analytics, and otherwise improve the safety, security, and performance of our Services) or to comply with our legal obligations. We only rely on our or a third party’s legitimate interests to process your Personal Information when these interests are not overridden by your rights and interests. 

3. When We Disclose Personal Information.

Except as described in this Policy or otherwise disclosed to you at the time of the collection, we will not disclose information about you that we collect on the Service to third parties without your consent. We may disclose information to third parties if you consent to us doing so, as well as in the following circumstances:

Any information that you voluntarily choose to include in a publicly accessible area of the Service will be available to anyone who has access to that content, including other users.
We work with third party service providers to provide website, application development, hosting, maintenance, and other services for us. These third parties may have access to or process information about you as part of providing those services for us. Generally, we limit the information provided to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions, and we require them to agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information.
We may disclose information about you if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws, in response to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental agencies.

We also reserve the right to disclose information about you that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to:

(i) take precautions against liability;
(ii) protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity;
(iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations;

L) Disputes

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. You and the Company agree that, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, you and the Company shall seek to resolve any and all disputes between the Company and you, respectively, including, without limitation, all claims, counter-claims and cross-claims (collectively, ""Claims""), whether in law, equity or otherwise, solely through individual arbitration in accordance with the policies and procedures set forth in this Agreement. Such disputes shall include without limitation:

disputes arising out of and/or otherwise relating to Company’s Terms of Service, Content and Conduct Policy, and/or Privacy Policy;
disputes arising out of and/or otherwise relating to any Services and/or any content on our Services;
disputes arising out of and/or otherwise relating to any information, communications and/or other material that you and/or any other person and/or entity provide to and/or through the Services;
disputes arising out of and/or otherwise relating to any information and/or other material that is collected, stored and/or disseminated by, on behalf of and/or with the approval of the Company;
disputes arising out of and/or otherwise relating to any advertising and/or other communications by the Company in connection with the Services;
disputes that are the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class;
disputes that arose before you entered into this Agreement and/or any prior version of this Agreement;
disputes that may arise after you terminate your registration with the Services; and
disputes arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.

Despite the language agreed to above and as an alternative to arbitration, either you and/or the Company may bring an individual action against the other in small claims court. Additionally, you and/or the Company may bring any Claim against the other to the attention of a federal, state and/or local government entity, which may elect to seek relief against the Company on your behalf, and/or against you on the Company’s behalf.

You agree that you and the Company have voluntarily and intentionally waived any and all right to a trial by jury, and (except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement) any and all right to participate in a class action. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Dispute provision. This Dispute provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.

For you or the Company to initiate arbitration against the other party it must first send by certified mail to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (""Notice""). The Notice must identify and detail the nature of the party's Claim, the basis for that Claim, and the specific relief being sought for that Claim, including, without limitation, any Claim for injunctive relief. For the parties' convenience, a form for providing Notice is available at http://www.tagged.com/disputeresolution_forms.html to download and complete. A Notice being sent to the Company must be addressed to: Dispute Resolution Department, The Meet Group, Inc., Attention: General Counsel, 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938 (“Company Notice Address""). A Notice being sent to you shall be sent to the e-mail address associated with your Services account and to any other e-mail address provided in your registration (collectively, ""Member Notice Address""). You may also opt to receive a copy of any Notice via mail by sending a written request to the Company Notice Address including your name, postal address, Member Notice Address and Services User ID number (UID).

After receipt of the Notice you and the Company must attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute set forth in the Notice. If you and the Company are not able to resolve the dispute within 30 days after the Notice is received, then you or the Company may initiate an arbitration proceeding against the other by downloading and completing the ""American Arbitration Association (""AAA"") Consumer-Related-Disputes Form-California (For Use Only In California)"" demand for arbitration form available at Demand for Arbitration (""Demand""), and sending a copy of the Demand to the AAA, together with a copy of the Terms of Service and a check or money order payable to the AAA in the amount of the appropriate filing fee, and sending a copy of the Demand to the other party. The copy of the Demand being sent to the AAA must be addressed as stated on the Demand. A copy of the Demand being sent to the Company must be addressed to the Company Notice Address. A copy of the Demand being sent to you shall be addressed to the Member Notice Address.

Please note AAA does not provide the Company customer support and is only able to provide information regarding initiating an arbitration proceeding against the Company. All concerns regarding your account should be addressed to the Company by submitting a Ticket. The Company will try to resolve your concern, and in the case that you are not satisfied with the resolution you may choose to follow the process outlined on the Dispute Resolution Page.

Information regarding the appropriate filing fee to send with the Demand to the AAA (including the possible waiver of all or part of that fee) is available at AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules and https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTAGE2026862, or by calling AAA Customer Service at (800) 778-7879 or AAA Case Filing Services at (877) 495-4185. If you initiate an arbitration proceeding against the Company and are not able to pay all or part of the AAA filing fee (and do not receive a waiver of the unpayable amount), and so long as the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the Demand is $10,000 or less, then you may send a written request for payment of the unpayable amount to the Company at the Company Notice Address. The Company shall consider your request and will, in its own discretion, either (1) pay the unpayable amount to the AAA directly or (2) send notice to you of its denial of your request within 10 business days of the receipt thereof. Further, if you initiate an arbitration proceeding against the Company, and so long as the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the Demand is $10,000 or less, then you may send proof of your payment of all or part of the AAA filing fee to the Company at the Company Notice Address, and the Company shall reimburse you for that actually paid amount.

The arbitration shall be administered by the AAA and shall be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures and the AAA Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, ""AAA Rules""), as modified by this Agreement. The AAA Rules are available online at AAA Consumer Arbitration and Consumer Arbitration Rules, or by calling AAA Customer Service at (800) 778-7879. (Additional information about the arbitration process, presented in a simplified FAQ format, is available at http://www.tagged.com/disputeresolution.html. The arbitrator selected to resolve the dispute between you and the Company shall bound by the terms of this Agreement. All arbitration hearings shall take place exclusively in San Francisco County, California. Except, however, that if the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is $10,000 or less you may choose whether the arbitration shall be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephone hearing, or by an in-person hearing, as established by the AAA Rules. If the total amount you are seeking is greater than $10,000 then your and the Company’s respective rights to an arbitration hearing shall be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which any award is based.

In addition to any reimbursement of AAA filing fees as detailed above, and so long as the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is $10,000 or less, the Company shall pay all other AAA administration fees and all arbitrator fees for the arbitration. Except, however, that if the arbitrator in such action finds that either the substance of your dispute against the Company or the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees in such action shall be governed by the AAA Rules. In said event, you hereby agree to reimburse the Company for all monies paid by the Company that are your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Additionally, if the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is greater than $10,000 then the payment of all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules.

You and the Company agree that unless and until the arbitrator determines the monetary and/or other relief, if any, to which you and/or the Company is entitled in connection with the dispute being arbitrated, neither you nor the Company shall disclose to the arbitrator the amount of any settlement offer(s) that you and/or the Company previously made to the other in connection with said dispute. In any individual arbitration between you and the Company, if the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of the Company’s last written settlement offer to you then the Company shall:

pay you the amount of the award or $2,500 (the ""Member Incentive""), whichever is greater; and
pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of any fees, and reimburse said attorney any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs), that said attorney reasonably and actually accrues in investigating, preparing and pursuing your Claim against the Company in the arbitration (collectively, the ""Attorney Incentive"").

However, if the Company did not make any written settlement offer to you prior to the arbitrator in said individual arbitration issuing you an award, then so long as the arbitrator awards you any monetary relief on the merits of your Claim against the Company, you and your attorney (if any) shall be entitled to receive the Member Incentive and the Attorney Incentive, respectively. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of any fees and/or expenses, the Member Incentive and/or the Attorney Incentive at any time during the individual arbitration and/or upon request by you and/or the Company made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits of said individual arbitration. The Attorney Incentive supplements and does not supersede any right you may have under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses in connection with the individual arbitration (including as may be awarded to you by the arbitrator), but in no event may you recover a duplicative award of attorneys' fees and/or expenses. If the Company prevails in an individual arbitration against you and is entitled under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses, the Company hereby agrees that it shall not seek and shall refuse to receive such an award.

The arbitrator may award any form of individual relief in your favor, but solely to the extent warranted by your individual Claim. You and the Company agree that, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, you and the Company may bring a Claim against the other solely in your or the Company’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, except as otherwise set forth herein, no arbitrator may consolidate more than one person's Claim and/or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If all or part of this specific paragraph is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable after final appeal, then the entirety of this Dispute provision shall be deemed null and void.

AT ANY TIME AND IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION THE COMPANY MAY DIRECT THE AAA TO CONSOLIDATE ANY AND ALL PENDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION CLAIMS THAT (i) ARISE IN SUBSTANTIAL PART FROM THE SAME AND/OR RELATED TRANSACTIONS, EVENTS AND/OR OCCURRENCES, AND (ii) INVOLVE A COMMON QUESTION OF LAW AND/OR FACT WHICH, IF RESOLVED IN MULTIPLE INDIVIDUAL AND NON-CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS, MAY RESULT IN CONFLICTING AND/OR INCONSISTENT RESULTS. IN SAID EVENT, YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION, IN LIEU OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, OF ANY AND ALL CLAIMS YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST THE COMPANY AND THE AAA RULES SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL GOVERN ALL PARTIES. Additionally, in said event, if the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Company’s last written settlement offer to you then the Company shall:

pay you the amount of the award or three times the amount of the Company’s last written settlement offer to you (the ""Member Incentive""), whichever is greater; and
pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of any fees, and reimburse said attorney any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs), that said attorney reasonably and actually accrues in investigating, preparing and pursuing your Claim against the Company in the arbitration (collectively, the ""Attorney Incentive"").

However, if the Company did not make any written settlement offer to you prior to the arbitrator in said consolidated arbitration issuing you an award, then so long as the arbitrator awards you any monetary relief on the merits of your Claim against the Company, then you shall be entitled to receive the award and/or $500, whichever is greater, and your attorney (if any) shall be entitled to receive the Attorney Incentive. As also noted above, the arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of any fees and/or expenses, the Member Incentive and/or the Attorney Incentive at any time during the consolidated arbitration and/or upon request by you and/or the Company made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits of said arbitration. Similarly, the Attorney Incentive supplements and does not supersede any right you may have under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses in connection with the consolidated arbitration (including as may be awarded to you by the arbitrator), but in no event may you recover a duplicative award of attorneys' fees and/or expenses. If the Company prevails in a consolidated arbitration against you and is entitled under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses, the Company hereby agrees that it shall not seek and shall refuse to receive such an award. If all or part of this specific paragraph is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable after final appeal, then the entirety of this Dispute provision shall be deemed null and void.

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that if the Company changes this Disputes provision in the future (other than a change to the Company Notice Address and/or any Internet address, telephone number and/or document title set forth in this provision) you may reject that change by sending written notice within 30 days of the change to the Company at the Company Notice Address. By rejecting said change you reaffirm that you shall seek to resolve all disputes between you and the Company solely through arbitration in accordance with this Agreement.

If there is a dispute between participants on the Services, or any third party, the Company is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that Member has a dispute with one or more members, Member hereby releases the Company and its directors, officers, employees, agents, independent contractors, representatives, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns and licensees from all claims, actions, losses, liabilities, judgments, damages, costs and expenses of every kind or nature (regardless of whether actual or consequential, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed), arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or any the Services. If Member is a California resident, Member hereby waives California Civil Code Section 1542, which says ""A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.""

N) Termination

Either party may terminate use of the Services with or without cause at any time and effective immediately upon written notice to the other party. The Company may terminate with or without cause at any time and effective immediately, at the Company’s sole discretion, including but not limited to Member's failure to conform with these terms and conditions of the Agreement. the Company shall not be liable to Member or any third party for termination of use of the Services or Services.

P) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE COMPANY BE LIABLE AS A RESULT OF MEMBER'S USE OR MISUSE OF THE COMPANY SERVICES, WHETHER THE DAMAGES ARISE FROM USE OR MISUSE OF THE COMPANY SERVICES, FROM INABILITY TO USE THE COMPANY SERVICES, OR THE INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, MODIFICATION, ALTERATION, OR TERMINATION OF THE COMPANY SERVICES. SUCH LIMITATION SHALL ALSO APPLY WITH RESPECT TO DAMAGES INCURRED BY REASON OF OTHER SERVICES OR PRODUCTS RECEIVED THROUGH OR ADVERTISED IN CONNECTION WITH THE THE COMPANY SERVICES OR ANY LINKS ON THE COMPANY SERVICES, AS WELL AS BY REASON OF ANY INFORMATION OR ADVICE RECEIVED THROUGH OR ADVERTISED IN CONNECTION WITH THE THE COMPANY SERVICES OR ANY LINKS ON THE COMPANY SERVICES. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. In some jurisdiction, limitations of liability are not permitted. In such jurisdictions, the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.

Q) Indemnification

Member agrees to hold the Company harmless from any claims and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, related to Member's violation of this Agreement.

R) Governing Law

If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, you and the Company nevertheless agree that the court should strive to give effect to your and the Company’s intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Agreement shall remain unaffected and in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the Company Services and/or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

Il periodo di conservazione effettivo dipende da una varietà di fattori, quali il tipo di prodotto, il tipo e il grado di sensibilità dei dati, le esigenze aziendali, le aspettative e le esigenze del cliente, i tipi di controlli l'utente disponibili e la forma in cui sono conservati i dati.
9. TRASFERIMENTI INTERNAZIONALI DELLE VOSTRE INFORMAZIONI
9.1	La nostra società ha sede in Giappone e le vostre informazioni personali da noi raccolte saranno conservate prevalentemente in Francia e Germania. Ciò comporterà un trasferimento di dati al di fuori del SEE o del Regno Unito.

(b)	Laddove utilizziamo fornitori con sede negli Stati Uniti, possiamo trasferire dati a tali fornitori nell'ambito dello Scudo per la Privacy, qualora vi aderiscano, in virtù del quale gli stessi sono obbligati a garantire eguale protezione ai dati personali condivisi tra Europa e Stati Uniti. Per ulteriori dettagli, vedere Commissione europea: Scudo per la Privacy UE-USA.

Ci possono essere eccezioni a tali diritti in determinate circostanze e, qualora non possiate esercitare un diritto a causa di un'eccezione, vi forniremo tale spiegazione.

11. LINK DI TERZI
La nostra App può includere link a siti web, plug-in e applicazioni di terze parti. Facendo clic su tali link o abilitando tali collegamenti, è possibile che terzi possano raccogliere o condividere i dati che vi riguardano. Non controlliamo questi siti web, plug-in e app di terze parti e non siamo responsabili delle loro dichiarazioni sulla privacy. Quando lasciate il nostro sito web, vi invitiamo a leggere l'informativa sulla privacy di ogni terza parte che visitate.
12. CHE TIPO DI INFORMAZIONI RACCOGLIAMO SUI BAMBINI?
12.1	Se un utente ha indicato di essere un bambino quando tenta di utilizzare la nostra App, lo indirizzeremo a un'esperienza diversa all'interno della nostra App che consente a un bambino di utilizzare i nostri servizi come qualsiasi altro utente, ma che non consente la raccolta di ulteriori informazioni personali (come definito in COPPA).
12.2	Raccogliamo solo una parte delle informazioni personali di cui sopra quando un utente si identifica come un bambino, compresi nome utente e identificativi univoci. I bambini possono utilizzare la nostra App, visualizzare i contenuti e usufruire di molte funzioni senza la raccolta di informazioni personali (come definito in COPPA) e, qualora il consenso del genitore sia richiesto dalla legge, lo richiederemo.
13. ULTERIORI DIRITTI DI PRIVACY PER I RESIDENTI IN CALIFORNIA
13.1	Il presente paragrafo fornisce informazioni aggiuntive richieste dalla legge californiana.
13.2	Se siete un consumatore californiano i cui dati personali sono raccolti tramite l'App (""cliente""), il California Consumer Privacy Act (""CCPA"") vi conferisce alcuni diritti in relazione a tali dati personali. In particolare, avete il diritto di richiedere che le aziende vi forniscano le seguenti informazioni:

13.4	È possibile esercitare i diritti di cui sopra contattandoci utilizzando i recapiti di cui al paragrafo 2 della presente Informativa sulla privacy. Se inviate una richiesta, vi chiederemo di verificare la vostra identità dove, se possibile, possiamo abbinare i vostri dati identificativi con i dati personali che abbiamo su di voi, a seconda del tipo di richiesta effettuata e delle misure di verifica proporzionali al rischio dei dati personali coinvolti nella richiesta (o nelle richieste). Non esiste un metodo ragionevole con cui possiamo verificare la vostra identità nel grado di certezza richiesto dalla legge per alcune informazioni personali, ad esempio: identificativi univoci come ID cookie, ID del dispositivo e indirizzo IP (laddove tali informazioni non sono in nostro possesso in relazione a informazioni direttamente identificabili). Ci possono essere eccezioni a tali diritti in determinate circostanze e, qualora non possiate esercitare un diritto a causa di un'eccezione, Pokémon vi fornirà tali informazioni. Pokémon si adopererà ragionevolmente per soddisfare la richiesta dell'utente entro i tempi di risposta previsti dalle leggi applicabili.
13.5	Pokémon non vende le vostre informazioni personali come definite dal CCPA e non lo ha fatto negli ultimi 12 mesi.
13.6	Oltre alle finalità per cui le vostre informazioni personali sono condivise con altre terze parti (inclusi i consulenti professionali) di cui ai precedenti paragrafi 5.1(e) e 6, un’altra finalità prevista è la condivisione per scopi aziendali che richiedono l'accesso ai nostri sistemi contenenti informazioni personali (come la fornitura di spazio di archiviazione di dati nel cloud, il mantenimento della sicurezza dei nostri sistemi e la fornitura di assistenza clienti). Negli ultimi 12 mesi, abbiamo comunicato ai fornitori tutte le categorie di dati personali descritte nel paragrafo 3.
13.7	L'articolo 1798.83 del Codice Civile della California consente ai clienti residenti in California di richiedere determinate informazioni relative alla divulgazione di informazioni personali a terzi per i propri scopi di marketing diretto. Non condividiamo i dati personali dei nostri clienti con terzi non affiliati per i loro scopi di marketing diretto senza il consenso dell'utente. Per richieste di informazioni sulla nostra policy in materia di divulgazione, non esitate a contattarci utilizzando i recapiti di cui al paragrafo 2.

Updated: August 16, 2021

This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how MediaLab.Ai (“MediaLab” or “we” or “us”) collects, uses, and shares your information when you use our website (“Website”), or other products or features we offer, including the following: Whisper; Kik; Datpiff; Worldstar; Amino; Coco; Manga and any other features, apps, technologies, software, products, or services offered by MediaLab (collectively with Website, the “Services”).  By accessing and using any of our Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Service.

This Privacy Policy applies to our Services that link to or reference this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites or applications maintained by third parties that we may link to or that may be accessible to you through our Services.  

INFORMATION WE COLLECT

To provide you the Services, we collect the categories of information described below. 

·  Information you provide us when using our Services;

·  Information we collect automatically;

·  Information we get from advertisers, third parties, and offline sources;

·  Any other information you choose to provide to us.

Most of the data collection and uses described in this Privacy Policy are necessary in order for us to be able to provide you the Services.  If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, we will not be able to provide you usage of the Services.  Some of the data collection and uses are not strictly necessary for us to provide the Services, but they are related, and our basis for such collection and processing is for legitimate interests we may have, such as to analyze and improve the Services as explained in more detail below.  If you want to know how to exercise your rights to manage or delete the personal information we may have about you, please review “YOUR CHOICES” below. 

Information You Provide Us When Using Our Services.

·  Account Information.  When you sign up to become a user of our Services, we collect personal information you choose to provide us, which may include your name, address, email, and phone number.  We may also ask you for, or you may choose to provide, additional information, such as age or gender that will be associated with your Services account. All of this information that may identify, relate to, describe, reference, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household, or device is called “Personal Information”.  Personal information does not include: (a) Publicly available information from government records; (b) De-identified or aggregated consumer information; or (c) Information excluded from the California Consumer Protection Act, such as: (i) health or medical information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) or clinical trial data; (ii) personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), and the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act of 1994.

·  User Content.  We collect the content, communications and other information you provide when you use our Services, including when you sign up for an account, create or share content, and message or communicate with others (collectively, “User Content”).  For example, we review the text and/or image content of your posts, replies, chat messages, and collect metadata regarding such messages that may collect the identity of the user and any users they communicate with.  All posts of contents and replies are public and are publicly displayed (for information deleting content, please see “YOUR CHOICES” below). User Content may be viewed, shared and modified by our users, us and others for commercial or personal purposes (consistent with the rights and licenses in our Terms of Service).  We collect information you choose to upload, sync or import from a device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know.  Please keep in mind that if you include information that could identify you in any content you share or post, people who see it may determine your identity. MediaLab does not post chat messages publicly but, as with any message that you send via any service, the recipient might do so.

·  Your Purchase Transactions.  If you make any purchases or engage in any other financial transactions through our Services, we collect information necessary to process the transaction. This includes payment information, such as your credit card or payment account information; authentication information; and billing, shipping and contact details.

Information We Collect Automatically When Using Our Services.

·  Location Information.  Many features of the Services will not work unless you provide us with some information about your location. If you consent to the collection of location information (e.g. if you permit your mobile device to send us your latitude and longitude), we will collect and use this information both while you are directly using the Services and in the “background” (i.e. at times when you are not directly using the Services). For example, we or our advertising partners may show you content or posts from people around you or places you frequently visit, notifications of things happening around you in real time, or advertisements from businesses near your location. If you do not permit your mobile device to provide us with location information, or location information is not available from your device for technical reasons, we may use your IP address or information about the WiFi SSID from which you access the Services to determine an approximate geographic location for your device. For more details about how you may control the collection of location information, please see “YOUR CHOICES” below.

·  Usage Information.  We collect information about your use of the Services, including access times, pages viewed, user and content interactions and other information about your interactions with our Services, as well as with other users, hashtags, and groups across our Services. 

·  Device Information.  We collect information from and about the devices and browsers you use that integrate with our Services.  For example, we collect device type, which may include the hardware model, operating system and version, browser type and language, IP Address, plugins, app and file names and types, battery and signal strength, available storage space, unique device identifiers and mobile network information (which is treated as personal information in some jurisdictions, but which we use only to identify your geographic area and to comply with applicable laws), information you give us access to through device settings such as photos, camera, or GPS location, identifiers associate with cookies, web beacons or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser.  We may combine this information across different devices you use.  For example, we use information collected about your use of our Services on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or features you see when you use our Services on another device, such as your laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad we showed you on your phone on a different device. 

·  Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.  Like most websites and applications, we and our service providers use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us and our service providers to, among other things, improve our Services and your experience by seeing which areas and features of our Services are popular. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, please see “YOUR CHOICES” below.  Keep in mind that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of some Services.

Information We Get From Advertisers, Third Parties, and Offline Sources.

We may receive information about you from advertisers, app developers, and publishers, or other online or offline sources with whom you interact and who have the rights to provide us with your information.  For example, advertisers, publishers, and other third parties may share how you interact with their ads, websites, or apps, how you use their services, or what purchases you make. This information may be provided whether or not you are logged in to a MediaLab Product at the time. We may combine such information with the information you have provided to us in order to provide and improve our Services. We require each of these advertisers, publishers, or other third parties to have lawful rights to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us.

Any Other Information You Choose To Provide To Us.

You may provide other information directly to us. For example, we may collect information when you fill out a form, update your account, interact with the Services, apply for a job at our company, communicate with us via third-party social media sites, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us.

o   With your consent or at your direction.

THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, LINKS, AND INTEGRATIONS

As noted above, our websites, webforms and mobile application will contain third-party content, links, and integrations. For example, when you use our Services you may be presented with content and links to an advertiser's website to learn more about their products and services. Through these integrations, you will be providing information to an advertiser, other third parties, as well as to us. We are not responsible for how an advertiser and such other third parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to read the privacy policies of every advertiser and third-party service that you visit or use.

HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION

How long we keep your information depends on the type of information, the purpose for which it is used, how sensitive it is, and other similar factors.  For example, we keep your information:

·  That you submit through our Services (like your name, phone number, address, email address, etc.) until you ask us to delete it.

·  For the length of time reasonably needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy (including for as long as need to provide you with our Services), unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

·  For as long as necessary to investigate and resolve disputes and/or enforce our rights and agreements, including if your account is disabled for violation of our policies.

·  Indefinitely if it is aggregated, anonymized, and de-identified (i.e., not capable of identifying you).

·  In our backup or disaster recovery systems for a limited period of time or as required by applicable law.

If you ever decide to stop using our Services, you can ask us to delete your information (see “YOUR CHOICES” to learn more).  Keep in mind, while our systems are designed to carry out our deletion automatically, we cannot promise or guarantee that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe. Also, there may be legal requirements to keep and not delete your information when you make a deletion request to us. This means we may suspend deletion of or not delete your information if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve your information, if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations, or if your use of our Services or your information is flagged by our automated systems for abuse or other Terms of Service violations.

HOW WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE

The security of your personal information is very important, and we take a number of steps to safeguard it. For example, we have implemented technical and organizational security measures that are designed to help protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification. We also maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with or exceed federal standards to guard your information, and we anonymize or expunge data when it is no longer necessary to provide Services to our users or substantiate records for an advertiser. From time-to-time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technologies and methods.

Even so, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect, impenetrable, or 100% secure. We cannot ensure, and do not warrant or guarantee, that the information you transmit to us will remain secure, nor do we guarantee that this information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, destroyed or used in an unauthorized manner. These are the risks of being online and conducting business online.

Of course, if we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may also post a notice on our Services if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive a notice of a security breach in writing. If you have any questions about the security of your information, please contact us via our privacy contact form.

YOUR CHOICES

We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools to exercise control over the information we have about you. Keep in mind that each option is subject to applicable legal limitations. Additionally, because your privacy is important to us, we will ask you to verify your identity/request or provide additional information before we let you exercise your choices over the information we have about you.

However, it is important to note that your deleted posts or contents may remain in storage in our systems for a limited period of time for legal, business, safety, or system backup reasons, and they may remain accessible in cached and archived pages of the Services or elsewhere if others have chosen to copy or save them. Search engines and other sites may also index and cache content on our Services. You may have to contact these third-party sites or search engines directly to delete your cached information, subject to their policies and procedures.

If you wish to delete your account, please contact us by using the “Email Support” link in settings from inside the applicable Product, or by using our contact form.  Remember that information that others have shared about you is not part of your account and will not be deleted.

As explained above, even after a deletion request, we may retain certain information as required by law, for legitimate business purposes, or for the safety of MediaLab (including its users) and others. We may also retain cached or archived copies of information about you for a certain limited period of time.

·  Deleting Location Information.

When you first download or open any of our mobile application Services or access certain features of the Services, you will be asked to consent to the collection of location information from your mobile device or platform. If you consent to the collection of this information but later wish to withdraw your consent, you may do so at any time by either changing the settings on your mobile device or deleting our mobile application Services from your device.

·  Opting Out Of Cookies And Other Technologies.

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default but also give you the option to manage and/or disable cookies and other online tracking technologies. To opt-out of the use of these technologies, you can usually change your browser options to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Keep in mind that not all devices and browsers are the same so the methods for disabling cookies on one browser may not be the same for different browsers or devices and may change at any time. Opting out of cookies and other tracking technologies may not preclude advertising networks from which you have not opted out from displaying customized advertising.  In addition, opting out will not prevent any advertising network from displaying advertising that is not customized to you and your interests and, consequently, may be less relevant to you.  You will need to make these choices on each browser and device you may use to visit our Services. 

When you elect to opt-out of cookies for a particular Service, an opt-out cookie is placed on your device. Then when you visit the same Service, the opt-out cookie tells the Service you opted out. This means that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services, including preventing your consent choices from being stored.  As a result, we may not know about, or be able to honor, your election to opt-out.  We encourage you to refer to the relevant instructions for your particular device or browser to learn how to manage cookies and other tracking technologies.  For more information on how to disable cookies on the most common browsers, we’ve assembled the following information for you below:

·  Do Not Track.  Some web browsers may transmit “do not track” signals (go here to learn more). Web browsers may incorporate or activate these features differently, making it unclear if users have consciously activated them.  As a result, we do not take steps to respond to such signals.

·  EUROPEAN VISITORS – COOKIES NOTICE. 

In connection with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applicable in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK-GDPR applicable in the UK, we eliminate or limit the use of cookies and similar technologies with visitors from the EEA and the UK (excluding our corporate website available at http://medialab.la, which continues to use cookies for all users with proper consent as explained below).  Specifically:

o   If you visit a third-party site that uses our Services, we will not place any cookies on your device unless you have provided your consent and been provided with notice of our privacy practices and your ability to opt-out at any time. We will not seek your consent to use cookies in this instance, though the advertiser or their website publisher may do so.

o   If you visit one of our Services, we will only place limited third-party cookies, such as those made available for analytics purposes by Google and Bing. In this case, we will seek your consent to use these third-party cookies and will only do so after you indicate your consent. If you do not consent, then no cookies will be written to your device.

o   If you are visiting our corporate website, http://medialab.la, for the first time, or the first time after we make a material change, we will seek your consent to use cookies.

o   If you do not consent, you will still be able to use our Services, but certain functionality may be limited. To enable this feature, we use third-party tools to determine your geographic location; if these tools indicate that you are in the EEA, then we treat your visit as above. If you feel that you are subject to GDPR, but we have nonetheless used cookies in connection with your visit without consent (which may be due to a failure of the third party geolocation tools, your use of a proxy server, your location outside of the EEA at the time of your visit, or some other factor beyond our control) please notify us through our privacy contact form, and make sure to include any relevant details so that we can ensure proper treatment of your data under GDPR.

WHERE INFORMATION IS PROCESSED & STORED

MediaLab is based in the United States and the information we collect is governed by U.S. law. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing and transfer of information in and to the U.S. These data transfers are performed only for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and are necessary to provide the Services to you globally.  We utilize standard contract clauses, rely on the European Commission’s adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States.  For EEA visitors, please read the “EUROPEAN VISITORS – COOKIES NOTICE.” section above to learn more about our use of cookies and other technology for visitors from EEA, as well as the “VISITORS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES” section below.

o   The categories of sources from which the personal information was collected;

o   The categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose;

o   If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:

§  Sales: identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and

§  Disclosures for a business purpose: identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.

To exercise this right, please see “Exercising Access, Data Portability, And Deletion Rights.” below.  Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request meets the requirements explained in the section “Exercising Access, Data Portability, And Deletion Rights.,” we will provide the requested information.  Keep in mind, if we do not have information that permits us to verify your identity, we may deny your request to access data.

·  Deletion Request Rights.  California residents have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.  To exercise this right, please see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights below.  Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request meets the requirements explained in the section Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.

We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:

Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, or otherwise perform our contract with you.

Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.

Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.

Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et. seq.).

Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.

Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.

Comply with a legal obligation.

Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it;

If we do not have information that permits us to verify your identity, we may deny your request to delete.

·  Exercising Access, Data Portability, And Deletion Rights.

o   Make a verifiable consumer request.  To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by using our privacy contact form. Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.  You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:

·   Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or are an authorized representative; and

·   Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.  Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.

For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights.

o   Response timing and format.  We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.  If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

·  Non-Discrimination.  We will not discriminate against any California resident for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

o   Deny you goods or services;

o   Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;

o   Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services;

o   Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.

·  Personal Information Sales Opt-Out And Opt-In Rights. 

Under California law, if you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the “right to opt-out”). We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is at least 13 but not yet 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.

To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” Section of our website.  Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by:  Accessing ‘Personal Data Consent' in ‘Settings’ on applicable Product being used.

You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.

·  Other California Privacy Rights.  California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Services that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  Requests can be made no more than once per calendar year.  To make such a request, please contact us using our privacy contact form and specify “Shine the Light Request.”  We will respond to your request within thirty (30) days of receiving it.

NEVADA RESIDENTS

Subject to certain exceptions, some of our data sharing practices may be considered a “sale” of your personal information under Nevada Revised Statutes 603A. Nevada residents may opt-out of the “sale” of personal information covered under the statute, by exercising your cookie consent options as detailed in Cookies and Other Technologies or by using our privacy contact form.

VISITORS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on our Services from residents of the United States. The data protection and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Where permitted by applicable law, we may transfer the personal data we collect about you to other jurisdictions other than where you reside that may not be deemed to provide the same level of data protection as your home country for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

By visiting or using our Services in any way, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy, regardless of the laws of your country of residence. 

To the extent the laws of another jurisdiction apply to your data or use of our Services, we will comply with such laws. For example, for European Visitors, read the “EUROPEAN VISITORS – COOKIES NOTICE.” section of Cookies and Other Technologies to learn more about our use of cookies and similar technologies with visitors from the EEA. 

EU Visitors

If you are an EU citizen or UK citizen, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation or the UK-GDPR  (collectively, the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below. For this section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure. We will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services. Note that we may also process Personal Data of our customers’ end users in connection with our provision of certain Services, in which case we are the processor of Personal Data. If we are the processor of your Personal Data (i.e., not the controller), please contact the controller party in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data. If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us using our privacy contact form.

The legal bases for which we collect and use the information described above depends on what the information is and why we collected it. The four bases upon which we rely include:

Contract. This means we need the information to perform our contracted Services with you. When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Services that require that data.

Legitimate Interests. This means we have a legitimate interest that does not outweigh your privacy rights. When we collect and process information based on our legitimate interests, we consider how we can accomplish what we need to in a way that is the least obtrusive on your privacy. For example, it is in our interest to protect your safety and security in the Services, so we collect and use information that has been flagged by users or requested by law enforcement; to make sure you are satisfied with how the services work, troubleshoot technical problems or develop new features, we collect and use information about how you and others use the services and to respond to your service inquiries, we collect and use information in that request and, if relevant to the inquiry, information about how you access and use the services.

Legal Obligation. We may need to use your personal information to comply with a law enforcement preservation request, subpoena, or other legal process or to protect the rights of other users.

Consent. If we have no other legal basis for collecting or using your information, we will ask you for consent for a specific purpose. If we do, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not apply to any processing conducted in reliance on lawful processing bases other than consent.

In addition to other rights detailed in the policy (such as requesting deletion, correction or updating of your personal information), EU and UK citizens have certain rights regarding your personal information, including:

Right to Object or Restrict Processing.  You have the right to object to or restrict our use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes or under certain circumstances when the legal bases for using your information is based upon our legitimate interest. If you wish to object to our use of your information, you can send us a request to delete your account by using our privacy contact form. 

Right to Access or Erasure.  You have the right to have your personal data erased and no longer processed. You also have the right to access the Personal Data we have collected about you.  You can send us a request to delete your account or access your information by using our privacy contact form.  Upon receiving the request, we will make a reasonable effort to delete your personal information from the Service and from our internal network within a reasonable period of time as long as we are not obligated to preserve your information due to things like law enforcement preservation requests, subpoenas, investigations, litigation, or otherwise meet any of our other legal obligations. We may also retain depersonalized information after deletion.

Withdrawal of Consent. If we are processing your Personal Data based on your consent (as indicated at the time of collection of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note, however, that if you exercise this right, you may have to then provide express consent on a case-by-case basis for the use or disclosure of certain of your Personal Data if such use or disclosure is necessary to enable you to utilize some or all of the Services.  You can exercise your right to withdraw consent by using our privacy contact form. 

Data Portability.  You can exercise your right to export your personal data by using our privacy contact form. 

File a Complaint. You have the right to complain to the data protection authority located in your Member State. To find contact details, click here.

As explained above, personal data collected in the EU or UK may be transferred to, and/or stored at, a destination outside of the EU and/or UK and processed by employees operating outside of the EU and/or UK who work for us, one of our business partners, or service providers. We have implemented sufficient GDPR compliant procedures to secure the transfer of your personal data to the United States. We utilize standard contract clauses, rely on the European Commission’s adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States.

CHILDREN’S INFORMATION

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13.

Additionally, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from anyone under the age of 16 in countries subject to the EU GDPR, unless exempted by individual country exceptions.

If you are under 13, or 16 where applicable, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the required minimum age, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under the required minimum age may have provided us personal information, please contact us using our contact form. 

CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY

We reserve the right to amend this privacy notice at our discretion and at any time. When we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post a notice to our Services and will update the notice’s effective date.  We will give you an opportunity to review the changes before they go into effect.  Your continued use of the Services following notice of the changes constitutes your acceptance of the changes, so we encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you use our services.  If you do not agree to the updated Privacy Policy, you may delete your account(s).

We may also collect Personal Information from third parties, such as social media, payment processors, product vendors, and other partners. Our collection of this information allows us to provide you with the Service, establish, maintain and support your user account on the Service, and communicate with you in accordance with our Terms of Use.

Account; Login; Purchase. If you create an account, you will be asked to provide and we may collect certain information, including, but not limited to, your e-mail address and password selected by you. If you register for your account using social networking service credentials, we will collect your credentials in order to identify and log into the third party application or website and will retain your credentials to collect information from the social networking service. For example, if you sign in with your Facebook or Google account, we may collect information from your profile. If you make a purchase, you will be asked to provide certain information, including, but not limited to, first and last name, e-mail address, billing address, shipping address, phone number and credit card information. See “Payment Information; Third Party Payment Processor” below for more information on the handling of payments.
Payment Information; Third Party Payment Processor. We use a third party payment processor (currently Stripe) to assist in securely processing your personally identifiable payment information. The credit card information that you provide is encrypted and transmitted directly to Stripe. We do not store your credit card information and do not control and are not responsible for Stripe or its collection or use of your information. You may find out more about how Stripe stores and uses your credit card information by accessing Stripe’s privacy policy.
Request Product and Other Information. You may provide your e-mail address and other contact information to us in order to request product information or other information related to onXmaps products and services even if you do not sign up for an account or make a purchase.
Communications. In order to receive certain communications from us, you may be required to submit certain Personal Information to us, including, but not limited to, your name, e-mail address, phone number and other contact information. We collect this Personal Information for the purpose of communicating with you including via SMS text messaging. We provide SMS communication services using Braze. For further information regarding Braze’s collection and use of your Personal Information, please visit Braze’s privacy policy. 
Location Data. Certain features available in the Service provide us with your location information, including GPS coordinates in real time or through browser geolocation APIs (“GPS Location“). Your GPS Location may allow us to locate you with a high degree of precision. We use this GPS Location information in order to provide the Service. If the Service is unable to acquire your GPS Location, certain features of the Service may not be available to you. We may also collect and use GPS Location information to offer you products or services, to protect, enhance or update the Service and as described in Section 2 below.
Automatically Collected Information. Similar to other websites and online services, we may collect some information automatically and store it in log files. We may use Google Analytics or other third party analytics providers to collect this information about the Service. This collection may include, but is not limited to: your IP address, browser type and language, device type, referring/exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, landing pages, cookie information, the pages you requested and viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages and the date and time of each request you make. We collect this non-identifying information in order to better understand our users, to more efficiently operate our business, to promote our products and services and to improve the quality of the Service. We may automatically collect information using various tracking technologies, such as cookies and web beacons.
Cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a computer or smartphone for record-keeping purposes. Our third party analytics providers use cookies to record information about your activities while using the Service and to “remember” you when you return to the Service. Some cookies remain on your computer or device until you delete them. Others, like session ID cookies, expire when you close your browser. You may set your browser or device setting to attempt to reject cookies and you may still use the Service, however, certain features of the Service may not be available if your browser or device does not accept cookies. See the Section titled “Do Not Track Settings” below for more information on how the Service may respond to your browser or device settings. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties. See also “Third Party Analytics Providers” below.
Web Beacons. Web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are used to track the online movements of web or mobile app users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a computer’s hard drive or your smartphone, web beacons are small graphics that are about the size of the period at the end of the sentence that are embedded invisibly on, for example, web pages or in HTML-based e-mails. Our third party analytics providers may place web beacons on the Site that track what other websites you visit (both before and after visiting the Site) or on the Application for gathering related Application statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain Application content and verifying system and server integrity). Our third party analytics providers use information obtained from web beacons to help us improve our business and the Service. We do not control the use of web beacons by third parties.
Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses cookies and web beacons in order to collect demographic and interest-level information and usage information from users that access and use the Service, including, but not limited, to information about the pages where users enter and exit the Service and what pages users view on the Service, time spent, browser, operating system, device information, and IP address. Cookies and web beacons allow Google to recognize a user when a user visits or accesses the Service. Google uses the information it collects from the Service and other websites or services to share with us and other website operators information about users including, but not limited to, age range, gender, geographic regions, general interests and details about devices used to visit websites and purchase items. We take reasonable measures to prevent linking information we receive from Google with any of your Personal Information. For more information regarding Google’s use of cookies and collection and use of information see the Google Privacy Policy. To opt out of Google Analytics, please visit the Google Analytics Opt-Out Page to learn about opting out and installing the appropriate browser add-on.
Third Party Analytics Providers. We use third parties to help us operate and improve the Service. In doing so, we may share with these third parties non-personally identifiable information about users’ use of the Service. These third-party providers also use tracking technologies to collect information about you and your device. We do not control information collected by third parties and are not responsible for their use of that information.
“Do Not Track” Settings. Because we track Service usage information through the use of cookies, web beacons and other tracking mechanisms, your selection of the “Do Not Track” option provided by your browser or smartphone may not have any effect on our collection of information via tracking technologies. The only way to completely “opt out” of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser and smartphone to delete and disable cookies and other tracking/recording tools. However, getting a “Do Not Track” signal to work as you might want is difficult. Using browsers as an example, not all tracking technologies can be controlled by browsers; unique aspects of your browser might be recognizable even if you disable a tracking technology; not all settings will necessarily last or be effective; even if a setting is effective for one purpose, data still may be collected for another; and even if one website observes a “Do Not Track” signal, that website usually will not be able to control other websites.
INFORMATION USE

We will use your Personal Information to operate, manage, maintain, and administer your account and the Service; to fulfill your purchases; to provide you with customer service; to provide you with support or a more personalized experience; to communicate with you; to monitor and analyze Service usage; to market and improve the Service and develop and test new products, services, websites or applications; and to provide you information about products and services (including the products and services of third parties).

It is your choice whether to communicate with or share this content with another onXmaps user. We will use your Personal Information to enable you to find and link to other onXmaps users. If you choose to share content or access shared content, other users will have access to information such as your first name, last name initial, and profile photo.
Use of Non-Personally Identifiable and Aggregate Information. We may use non-Personal Information and aggregate information for any lawful purpose, including, but not limited to, analyzing trends, managing and administering the Service, tracking users’ movements, to create new products or services or to improve our business and the Service. We may also share aggregate information with third parties to develop and deliver targeted advertising and to analyze and report on the advertising you see. In addition, we may share aggregate statistical information with our business partners. We may also combine your non-personally identifiable information and aggregate information with other non-personally identifiable information and aggregate information collected from other sources. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that aggregate information is never associated with you or your Personal Information.
Information Retention. We may retain your information indefinitely, or as long as legally required or allowed, for our business needs and in order to deter fraud or abuse of the Service.

No transmission of data over the internet can be 100% secure.
INFORMATION SECURITY MEASURES

The Personal Information we collect is stored in operating environments that are not available to the public. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology.

YOUR CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY RIGHTS

You can choose not to provide Personal Information. You may always decline to provide your Personal Information to us. Registering for an account is not required to access some of our online content. If you decide to register, you can choose to provide information that does not reasonably identify you to others by selecting a username that is not related to your actual name. You can also decline to provide any optional information in your account. If you choose not to provide certain Personal Information to us, some of your experiences may be affected (for example, we cannot send you product and services information if you do not provide your e-mail address).

You May Decline Other Requests. We use your Personal Information as needed for the purposes for which it was collected or where you have consented to our use of such information. If you do not wish to provide information to us or do not wish to consent to the uses described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service, set up an account, or supply the requested information to us.

Right to Delete. You may have the right under the CCPA to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we have collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies. 

Right to Access Specific Information and Data Portability Right. You may have the right under the CCPA to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past twelve (12) months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:
The categories of Personal Information that we have collected about you.
The categories of sources for the Personal Information that we have collected about you.
Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or making available that Personal Information.
The categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal Information.
The specific pieces of Personal Information that we have collected about you (also called a data portability request).
If we disclosed your Personal Information for a Business Purpose, the Business Purpose for which such Personal Information was disclosed, and the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient obtained.
If applicable, (1) the categories of your Personal Information that we have made available for valuable consideration; (2) the categories of third parties to whom such Personal Information was made available; and (3) the category or categories of Personal Information that we have made available to each category of third parties.

We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) or vendor(s) to:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et. seq.).
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
Comply with a legal obligation or legal order.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
Right to Opt-Out. If you are 16 years of age or older, you may have the right under the CCPA to direct us not to make your Personal Information available for valuable consideration at any time (the “right to opt-out”). We do not make available the Personal Information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in may opt-out at any time.

To exercise the right to opt-out or right to opt-in, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by sending us an e-mail at support@onxmaps.com. Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize certain information sharing practices. However, you may change your mind and opt back in at any time by sending us an e-mail at support@onxmaps.com. We will only use Personal Information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.

Exercising Your Rights. To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by sending us an e-mail at support@onxmaps.com.

Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.

You may only make such a request for access or data portability twice within a twelve (12) month period. The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative, and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

We will respond to verifiable requests received from California residents as required by law. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the twelve (12) month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

Non-Discrimination. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.

CALIFORNIA SHINE THE LIGHT LAW

California Civil Code § 1798.83 permits users who are California residents to obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of third parties to whom we have disclosed Personal Information (if any) for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year.

Last updated: November  2020

 

This Bigo Live Privacy Policy explains how Bigo Live (“Bigo” “we” “us”) process any personal data we collect from visitors and users of  www.bigo.tv and any applications, services provided in relation to the website (collectively, the “Bigo Service”).

 

We value the privacy of users, subscribers, publishers, members, and others who visit and use the Bigo Services (collectively or individually, “you” or “users”) and want you to be familiar with how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from and about you.

 

You may share personal information when using the Bigo Services. One example is when you provide information about yourself as part of the Bigo account creation process. Another is when you take certain actions on the Bigo Services that are public or intended to be public in nature, such as when you broadcast content, post profile information, follow a channel, or subscribe to a broadcast channel. Given the social nature of some of the Bigo Services, that information may be collected, used, or disclosed by others who are part of that social interaction. In addition, some features of the Bigo Services are designed to provide others with information about user activity, such as identifying the user who created a particular Clip or the subscription status of users for a given channel. We encourage you to be mindful of this when considering your activity on the Bigo Services.

You represent and warrant that: (1) you are the creator or own or control all right in and to the User Content or otherwise have sufficient rights and authority to grant the rights granted herein; (2) your User Content does not and will not: (a) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right, or (b) defame any other person; (3) your User Content does not contain any viruses, adware, spyware, worms, or other harmful or malicious code; and (4) unless you have received prior written authorization, your User Content specifically does not contain any pre-release or non-public beta software or game content or any confidential information of Twitch or third parties. Twitch reserves all rights and remedies against any users who breach these representations and warranties.

c. Content is Uploaded at Your Own Risk

Twitch uses reasonable security measures in order to attempt to protect User Content against unauthorized copying and distribution. However, Twitch does not guarantee that any unauthorized copying, use, or distribution of User Content by third parties will not take place. To the furthest extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby agree that Twitch shall not be liable for any unauthorized copying, use, or distribution of User Content by third parties and release and forever waive any claims you may have against Twitch for any such unauthorized copying or usage of the User Content, under any theory. THE SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT USER CONTENT USED BY TWITCH HEREIN ARE PROVIDED AND USED “AS-IS” AND WITH NO WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, CONDITIONS, ASSURANCES, OR OTHER TERMS THAT SUCH SECURITY MEASURES WILL WITHSTAND ATTEMPTS TO EVADE SECURITY MECHANISMS OR THAT THERE WILL BE NO CRACKS, DISABLEMENTS, OR OTHER CIRCUMVENTION OF SUCH SECURITY MEASURES.

d. Promotions

Users may promote, administer, or conduct a promotion (e.g., a contest or sweepstakes) on, through, or utilizing the Twitch Services (a “Promotion”). If you choose to promote, administer, or conduct a Promotion, you must adhere to the following rules: (1) You may carry out Promotions to the extent permitted by applicable law and you are solely responsible for ensuring that any Promotions comply with any and all applicable laws, obligations, and restrictions; (2) You will be classified as the promoter of your Promotion in the applicable jurisdiction(s) and you will be solely responsible for all aspects of and expenses related to your Promotion, including without limitation the execution, administration, and operation of the Promotion; drafting and posting any official rules; selecting winners; issuing prizes; and obtaining all necessary third-party permissions and approvals, including without limitation filing any and all necessary registrations and bonds. Twitch has the right to remove your Promotion from the Twitch Services if Twitch reasonably believes that your Promotion does not comply with the Terms of Service or applicable law; (3) Twitch is not responsible for and does not endorse or support any such Promotions. You may not indicate that Twitch is a sponsor or co-sponsor of the Promotion; and (4) You will display or read out the following disclaimer when promoting, administering, or conducting a Promotion: “This is a promotion by [Your Name]. Twitch does not sponsor or endorse this promotion and is not responsible for it.”.

e. Endorsements/Testimonials

You agree that your User Content will comply with the FTC’s Guidelines Concerning the Use of Testimonials and Endorsements in Advertising, the FTC’s Disclosures Guide, the FTC’s Native Advertising Guidelines, and any other guidelines issued by the FTC from time to time (the “FTC Guidelines”), as well as any other advertising guidelines required under applicable law. For example, if you have been paid or provided with free products in exchange for discussing or promoting a product or service through the Twitch Services, or if you are an employee of a company and you decide to discuss or promote that company’s products or services through the Twitch Services, you agree to comply with the FTC Guidelines’ requirements for disclosing such relationships. You, and not Twitch, are solely responsible for any endorsements or testimonials you make regarding any product or service through the Twitch Services.

f. Political Activity

Subject to these Terms of Service and the Community Guidelines, you may share political opinions; participate in political activity; provide links to a political committee’s official website, including the contribution page of a political committee; and solicit viewers to make contributions directly to a political committee. You agree, however, that these activities are entirely your own. Moreover, by engaging in these activities, you represent and warrant that you are eligible to engage in them under applicable law, and that you will abide by all relevant laws and regulations while doing so.

You agree not to solicit the use of or use any Twitch monetization tool (e.g., Bits or subscriptions) for the purpose of making or delivering a contribution to a candidate, candidate’s committee, political action committee, ballot committee, or any other campaign committee, or otherwise for the purpose of influencing any election. Candidates for political office are not eligible to use any Twitch monetization tool on their channels.

xv. attempt to circumvent any content filtering techniques we employ, or attempt to access any service or area of the Twitch Services that you are not authorized to access;

To the extent permitted by applicable law, Twitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content or for any loss or damage resulting therefrom, nor is Twitch liable for any mistakes, defamation, slander, libel, omissions, falsehoods, obscenity, pornography, or profanity you may encounter when using the Twitch Services. Your use of the Twitch Services is at your own risk. In addition, these rules do not create any private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Twitch Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.

Twitch is not liable for any statements or representations included in User Content. Twitch does not endorse any User Content, opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and Twitch expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Content. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Twitch reserves the right to remove, screen, or edit any User Content posted or stored on the Twitch Services at any time and without notice, including where such User Content violates these Terms of Service or applicable law, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any User Content you post or store on the Twitch Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Twitch Services in violation of the foregoing violates these Terms of Service and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Twitch Services.

For Residents of the Republic of Korea, except in the case where Twitch reasonably considers that giving notice is legally prohibited (for instance, when providing notice would either (i) violate applicable laws, regulations, or orders from regulatory authorities or (ii) compromise an ongoing investigation conducted by a regulatory authority) or that any notice may cause harm to you, third parties, Twitch, and/or its affiliates (for instance, when providing notice harms the security of the Twitch Services), Twitch will without delay notify you of the reason for taking the relevant step.

10. Respecting Copyright

Twitch respects the intellectual property of others and follows the requirements set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and other applicable laws. If you are the copyright owner or agent thereof and believe that content posted on the Twitch Services infringes upon your copyright, please submit a notice following our DMCA Guidelines, which include further information about our policies, what to include in your notice, and where to submit your notice.

11. Trademarks

TWITCH, the Twitch logos, and any other product or service name, logo, or slogan used by Twitch, and the look and feel of the Twitch Services, including all page headers, custom graphics, button icons, and scripts, are trademarks or trade dress of Twitch, and may not be used in whole or in part in connection with any product or service that is not Twitch’s, in any manner that is likely to cause confusion among customers, or in any manner that disparages or discredits Twitch, without our prior written permission. Any use of these trademarks must be in accordance with the Twitch Trademark Guidelines.

All other trademarks referenced in the Twitch Services are the property of their respective owners. Reference on the Twitch Services to any products, services, processes, or other information by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, supplier, or otherwise does not constitute or imply endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation thereof by us or any other affiliation.

12. Third-Party Content

In addition to the User Content, Twitch may provide other third-party content on the Twitch Services (collectively, the “Third-Party Content”). Twitch does not control or endorse any Third-Party Content and makes no representation or warranties of any kind regarding the Third-Party Content, including without limitation regarding its accuracy or completeness. Please be aware that we do not create Third-Party Content, update, or monitor it. Therefore we are not responsible for any Third-Party Content on the Twitch Services.

You are responsible for deciding if you want to access or use third-party websites or applications that link from the Twitch Services (the “Reference Sites”). Twitch does not control or endorse any such Reference Sites or the information, materials, products, or services contained on or accessible through Reference Sites, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind regarding the Reference Sites. In addition, your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in promotions of, advertisers found on or through the Twitch Services are solely between you and such advertiser. Access and use of Reference Sites, including the information, materials, products, and services on or available through Reference Sites is solely at your own risk.

13. Idea Submission

By submitting ideas, suggestions, documents, and/or proposals (the “Submissions”) to Twitch or its employees, you acknowledge and agree that Twitch shall be entitled to use or disclose such Submissions for any purpose in any way without providing compensation or credit to you.

14. Termination

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Twitch reserves the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the Twitch Services (including to post User Content) and to block or prevent your future access to and use of the Twitch Services, including where we reasonably consider that: (a) your use of the Twitch Services violates these Terms of Service or applicable law; (b) you fraudulently use or misuse the Twitch Services; or (c) we are unable to continue providing the Twitch Services to you due to technical or legitimate business reasons. Our right to terminate your license includes the ability to terminate or to suspend your access to any purchased products or services, including any subscriptions, Prime Gaming, or Turbo accounts. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, your only remedy with respect to any dissatisfaction with: (i) the Twitch Services, (ii) any term of these Terms of Service, (iii) any policy or practice of Twitch in operating the Twitch Services, or (iv) any content or information transmitted through the Twitch Services, is to terminate your account and to discontinue use of any and all parts of the Twitch Services.

For residents of the Republic of Korea, except in the case where Twitch reasonably considers that giving notice is legally prohibited (for instance, when providing notice would either (i) violate applicable laws, regulations, or orders from regulatory authorities or (ii) compromise an ongoing investigation conducted by a regulatory authority) or that any notice may cause harm to you, third parties, Twitch, and/or its affiliates (for instance, when providing notice harms the security of the Twitch Services), Twitch will without delay notify you of the reason for taking the relevant step.

15. Disputes

a. Indemnification

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Twitch, its affiliated companies, and each of our respective contractors, employees, officers, directors, agents,  third-party suppliers, licensors, and partners (individually and collectively, the “Twitch Parties”) from any claims, losses, damages, demands, expenses, costs, and liabilities, including legal fees and expenses, arising out of or related to your access, use, or misuse of the Twitch Services, any User Content you post, store, or otherwise transmit in or through the Twitch Services, your violation of the rights of any third party, any violation by you of these Terms of Service, or any breach of the representations, warranties, and covenants made by you herein. You agree to promptly notify the Twitch Parties of any third-party claim, and Twitch reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify Twitch, and you agree to cooperate with Twitch’s defense of these claims. Twitch will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.

b. Disclaimers; No Warranties

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW: (A) THE TWITCH SERVICES AND THE CONTENT AND MATERIALS CONTAINED THEREIN ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED TO THE CONTRARY IN WRITING BY TWITCH; (B) THE TWITCH PARTIES DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, STATUTORY, EXPRESS, OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT AS TO THE TWITCH SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT, OR MATERIALS CONTAINED THEREIN; (C) TWITCH DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE CONTENT OR MATERIALS ON THE TWITCH SERVICES ARE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, RELIABLE, CURRENT, OR ERROR-FREE; (D) TWITCH IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS OR OMISSIONS RELATING TO TEXT OR PHOTOGRAPHY; AND (E) WHILE TWITCH ATTEMPTS TO MAKE YOUR ACCESS AND USE OF THE TWITCH SERVICES SAFE, TWITCH CANNOT AND DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE TWITCH SERVICES OR OUR SERVER(S) ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND THEREFORE, YOU SHOULD USE INDUSTRY-RECOGNIZED SOFTWARE TO DETECT AND DISINFECT VIRUSES FROM ANY DOWNLOAD. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM TWITCH OR THROUGH THE TWITCH SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN.

c. Limitation of Liability and Damages

i. Limitation of Liability

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW: (A) IN NO EVENT SHALL TWITCH OR THE TWITCH PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS, OR LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE TWITCH SERVICES, THE CONTENT OR THE MATERIALS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY OR RESULTING FROM RELIANCE ON ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM TWITCH, OR THAT RESULT FROM MISTAKES, OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELETION OF FILES OR EMAIL, ERRORS, DEFECTS, VIRUSES, DELAYS IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, OR ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, WHETHER OR NOT RESULTING FROM ACTS OF GOD, COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE, THEFT, DESTRUCTION, OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO TWITCH’S RECORDS, PROGRAMS, OR SERVICES; AND (B) IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF TWITCH, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, WHETHER ACTIVE, PASSIVE, OR IMPUTED), PRODUCT LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE TWITCH SERVICES EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU, IF ANY, FOR ACCESSING THE TWITCH SERVICES DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE CLAIM OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS, WHICHEVER IS GREATER. TO THE EXTENT THAT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS LIMITATION OF SUCH LIABILITY, TWITCH SHALL LIMIT ITS LIABILITY TO THE FULL EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

ii. Reference Sites

THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ALSO APPLY WITH RESPECT TO DAMAGES INCURRED BY YOU BY REASON OF ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD OR PROVIDED ON ANY REFERENCE SITES OR OTHERWISE BY THIRD PARTIES OTHER THAN TWITCH AND RECEIVED THROUGH OR ADVERTISED ON THE TWITCH SERVICES OR RECEIVED THROUGH ANY REFERENCE SITES.

iii. Basis of the Bargain

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT TWITCH HAS OFFERED THE TWITCH SERVICES, USER CONTENT, MATERIALS, AND OTHER CONTENT AND INFORMATION, SET ITS PRICES, AND ENTERED INTO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE IN RELIANCE UPON THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN YOU AND TWITCH, AND THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND TWITCH. TWITCH WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE TWITCH SERVICES TO YOU ON AN ECONOMICALLY REASONABLE BASIS WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.

d. Applicable Law and Venue

(i) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and Twitch agree that if you are a Subscribing Organization or a consumer resident of a jurisdiction other than those in (ii) below, the following governing law and arbitration provision applies:

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH TWITCH AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM TWITCH.

You and Twitch agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms of Service or your use of the Twitch Services, except that you and Twitch are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. You and Twitch agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises. Notice to Twitch shall be sent to: Twitch Interactive, Inc., Attn: Legal, 350 Bush Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104. You and Twitch further agree: to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration; that any arbitration will occur in Santa Clara County, California; that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; and that the state or federal courts in Santa Clara County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. Any dispute between the parties will be governed by this Agreement and the laws of the State of California and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Twitch will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.

(ii) If you are a resident in any jurisdiction in which the provision in the section above is found to be unenforceable, then any disputes, claims, or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service will be governed by and construed under the laws of your jurisdiction of residence, and shall be resolved by competent civil courts within your jurisdiction of residence.

e. Claims

YOU AND TWITCH AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TWITCH SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

16. Miscellaneous
a. Waiver

If we fail to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service, it will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing and signed by the relevant party.

b. Severability

If any provision of these Terms of Service is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from these Terms of Service to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

c. Assignment

These Terms of Service, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Twitch without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of this Terms of Service shall be void.

d. Survival

Upon termination of these Terms of Service, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, Sections 7, 8, 11, 12, and 15-17.

e. Entire Agreement

The Terms of Service, which incorporate the Terms of Sale and the Community Guidelines, is the entire agreement between you and Twitch relating to the subject matter herein and will not be modified except by a writing signed by authorized representatives of both parties, or by a change to these Terms of Service made by Twitch as set forth in Section 6 above.

17. Requests for Information and How to Serve a Subpoena

All requests for information or documents related to potential, anticipated, or current legal proceedings, investigations, or disputes must be made using the appropriate level of legal process, and must be properly served on Twitch via the Corporation Service Company (CSC), Twitch’s national registered agent. Please find below the California address for CSC (the CSC office in your jurisdiction may be located through the Secretary of State’s website):

Twitch Interactive, Inc.
c/o Corporation Service Company
2710 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 150N
Sacramento, CA 95833

Please note that Twitch does not accept requests for information or documents, or service of process, via e-mail or fax and will not respond to such requests. All requests must include the information you may have that will help us identify the relevant records (particularly, the Twitch Service at issue, e.g., www.twitch.tv, and the username at issue, e.g., the Twitch username: http://www.twitch.tv/username), the specific information requested, and its relationship to your investigation. Please also note that limiting your request to the relevant records (e.g., a limited time period) will facilitate efficient processing of your request.

The Twitch Services are offered by Twitch Interactive, Inc., located at: 350 Bush Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104 and email: help@twitch.tv. If you are a California resident, you may have this same information emailed to you by sending a letter to the foregoing address with your email address and a request for this information.

18. Specific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch

Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music. By downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service. Twitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.

Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming. To make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists. Twitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.

The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel. Music and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services. What this means is that you may not:

Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack – we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music; or
Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.

Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.

Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time. Thus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws). Twitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.

Faelme: Princess Evol and her Fairy Prince
K. A. N
107194 words
If you would like a book with a beautiful and deep meaning to mate bonds... Faelme is an alternate universe in a lone earth Island. It Is inhabited by Faeries, Elves, and Mermaid and only magic can open the portal. Evol is the Elfin princess who is secretly a warrior against her mother's will. Her mum would rather have her settle down and get married to the Huge, Handsome and oh so Arrogant Fairy Prince, Curtis. Curtis instinctively knew that the Elvin princess was not the gentle and shy image she had been forced to present. Evol hated the fairy prince at first sight since he was always teasing her with his arrogant remarks and his signature c*cksure smirk. “Queen Layla, Princess Evol.” Curtis said with a slight bow by the way of a greeting. “Good day, Prince Curtis.” The Queen flashed him a brilliant smile. Evol, however, turned her glare on him eyeing him angrily, her big green eyes still blazing. Curtis wondered how much more it would him take to shatter her perfect princess facade completely. ""Prince Curtis, please excuse my daughter's poor manners."" The Queen said to him when time had passed enough that they realized Evol wasn't going to acknowledge his greetings. Not with words anyway. ""It is no problem, ma'am. It is always a pleasure to see princess Evol no matter how many times she pushes me away."" He replied putting his charms to use and the Queen totally fell for it. Only Evol recognized his smile for what it was, A mocking smirk. The egoistical bullhorn was mocking her. This vermin scum. This arrogance in faerie flesh. Evol thought as her mother shot her another look. The Prince had just made it seem like she had been ignoring his nonexistent advances. Feigning the best smile she could fake considering how mad she felt at that moment, she answered the prince. ""We were not in the best of situations the last time we met Curtis."" She intentionally addressed him by his first name to create an aura of familiarity for her mother's benefit. “You should smile more often, Evol."" Curtis replied back with a grin. The Queen, looked awfully pleased at their tiny jabs, mistaking the tension between them for something it was most definitely not. “Uhm... I should just excuse you both."" She said loudly to catch their attention, then she whispered to Evol, “Take all the time you need."" With a final smile, she walked away from them leaving them alone on the hallway. “Prince Curtis, what do you really want?"" Evol asked with clenched teeth once they were alone. “Back to formalities now, are we?"" He put his hand to his left chest and gave her the look of a kicked puppy. Evol was about to give him a scathing reply when noticed his eyes raking over her form from head to toe. To say that she was taken aback would be understatement. She was so caught off guard that she forgot what she was going to say. Why was he looking at her like that? And what was the meaning of that smile he was giving her? And why the heck was her face so hot? “How many hours did it take the royal healers to put you back together again?"" Her brain did not register his word for a full five seconds, and when it did she felt blood rush to her face. This time, from anger. “ I– uhm— What?"" Evol stuttered and got even more mad that he had just made a fool of her. He made her blush one second, and insulted her the next. No words could express how mad and embarrassed she was, so she settled for giving him her most poisonous glare which for some reason only seemed to fuel his amusement. Curtis felt his breathe catch at the sight of the adorable tiny princess glaring at him. Her wide green eyes only making her look even much more cute as they danced with fire. This, Curtis thought, was finally the princess Evol he had been subconsciously searching for. She looked liked a true Fiery Queen. That was the word that came to mind. Curtis took one, two steps towards her. Towering over her like a wall, his woodsy scent teasing her nostrils and making her stomach riot in protest. It took all of Evol's willpower not to take a cowardly step back and just run away from his presence. Dear God, he didn't stop there. He leaned down till he could graze his lips against the flesh of her ear lobe and whispered. “It's nice to finally meet you, Princess Evol."" Evol saw red, there was definitely laughter in his words. What did he mean by '...finally meet you?' Before she could think of a word civil enough to be uttered by a princess as a response, he carried his gigantic smirking self to his room, a door away. Evol could not even return to her own room, where her mother was sure to be waiting for her, from how embarrassed she felt. Prince Curtis had won this round, but she would win the next. She promised herself that. A rich and original enemies to lovers book with lots of surprises from start to finish. Ps: Mature Content

Keeping Superman’s Secret
Ally Parker

“You could’ve gotten yourself killed!” He took one more big step forwards so his chest was almost pressing against mine. His blue eyes lit up with his anger, blazing on mine and capturing me all at once. His hair was messed up beneath his mask as if he’d been running his hands through it and it made me want to reach up and knot my own hands in it. All I could do was stay frozen under his intense gaze, trembling not in the aftermath of today’s events, but in fear that he may never forgive me. In fear that I would never see him like this again. “Never do that again” Onyx whispered this time, his voice calming in alignment with his now softening eyes. His hand cupped my cheek, and I swear I could see his eyes begin to water. The anger that he had held seemed to fade away, and instead he pleaded with me. I nodded my head, still unable to move. He had never been this close to me before. My chest pressed against his and I could feel the rise and fall of his breath. “Forgive me,” he whispered and before I could wonder what he meant his lips were crashing down onto mine. I froze only momentarily to ponder whether this was really happening, but as his lips moved against mine I felt my body come alive. I was kissing Onyx, he was kissing me, and it was like the whole world around us had come to a stop. Up until now, Allison had survived her entire high school career unscathed. With less than 4 months until graduation, she’s got her life all figured out. She’s secured a stable part time job that allows her to save money for school while also working side by side with her best friend, and is already making plans to attend her dream college in the fall. But all this changes when Allison catches danger’s eye and is suddenly running into Onyx, San Fransisco’s local superhero more than she’d like to. While she was never one of the screaming fan girls begging for Onyx’s attention, Allison has caught it and now she can’t help but wonder - who’s behind the mask?

Education helped her lose 30 pounds.

MyFitnessPal gave me a wake up call to the way I was eating and made things clear what I needed to change.

-Stephanie

From fast-food addict to mindful eater.

I naturally fell into the concept of mindful eating… it takes 15-20 minutes for the food to hit your stomach, so I started eating slower.

-Eric

She was eager to make a change.

Now, when I have friends starting to run and getting frustrated, I tell them to just stick with it, eventually, you’ll get faster.
